### One night in Bangkok and the world is Apillon‚Äôs oyster


#### Returning from one of the most informative Polkadot events, sub0 Asia 2024 offered countless feedback, impressions, and new opportunities.


It all happened so fast and so productively that we needed a few days to regroup, gather our thoughts and make way for new alliances to form.


sub0 Asia 2024 was a blast of a conference. It mainly featured building on Polkadot, where we are most at home. Packed with valuable insights from top industry minds, the two-day event provided the Apillon team with the latest advances in the Polkadot ecosystem, tech announcements, and use cases limited to the Polkadot space.

### Apillon‚Äôs contribution


#### 1. On the¬†stage


Firstly, Apillon‚Äôs CTO, Tadej Vengust, shared his reviews on how to ‚ÄúTypeScript your way to building apps on Polkadot via Apillon.‚Äù Listen to his entire speech at the link below üëá

Tadej dived into decentralized app development on Polkadot parachains with Apillon SDK and talked about building with TypeScript to effortlessly explore the power of dapp creation. He walked the participants through the integrated parachains, their use cases, and features deriving from them on the Apillon platform.

#### 2. In the¬†moshpit


The workshop ‚ÄúUX/UI Conventions: Preparing the field so you can focus on the tech,‚Äù led by the Braille team, left us deeply optimistic as UX is one of the main attributes we pride ourselves on while designing the building platform for Web3 endeavors. Nino Kutnjak, CPO at Apillon, actively participated in what seems to be becoming a hot topic in the industry, UX- and accessibility-related debate.

Braille is a team of UX/UI experts on a mission to make the Polkadot ecosystem more approachable and intuitive. A more convenient and user-friendly interface is a must, especially if we want to provide seamless onboarding and lower the Web3 barrier for less-tech-savvy individuals who want to use Polkadot for its string of services and not solely for building.


The workshop was conducted so that teams could point out the biggest UX hurdles faced by Polkadot users. Once each team collected their choices, they presented those cases on the stage, bringing a broader awareness that many things could be refined to increase Polkadot's overall UX.


The primary purpose of the Braille initiative is to reach a broader community consensus regarding:


The workshop concluded with a clear commitment to kickstart the Polkadot UX initiative, which invited everyone from the ecosystem to participate in the debates that will soon follow.


A while ago, Nino wrote down some thoughts and his own UX/UI-related impressions; you can check through the main points here üëá
