### One night in Bangkok and the world is Apillon’s oyster


#### Returning from one of the most informative Polkadot events, sub0 Asia 2024 offered countless feedback, impressions, and new opportunities.


It all happened so fast and so productively that we needed a few days to regroup, gather our thoughts and make way for new alliances to form.


sub0 Asia 2024 was a blast of a conference. It mainly featured building on Polkadot, where we are most at home. Packed with valuable insights from top industry minds, the two-day event provided the Apillon team with the latest advances in the Polkadot ecosystem, tech announcements, and use cases limited to the Polkadot space.

### Apillon’s contribution


#### 1. On the stage


Firstly, Apillon’s CTO, Tadej Vengust, shared his reviews on how to “TypeScript your way to building apps on Polkadot via Apillon.” Listen to his entire speech at the link below 👇

Tadej dived into decentralized app development on Polkadot parachains with Apillon SDK and talked about building with TypeScript to effortlessly explore the power of dapp creation. He walked the participants through the integrated parachains, their use cases, and features deriving from them on the Apillon platform.

#### 2. In the moshpit


The workshop “UX/UI Conventions: Preparing the field so you can focus on the tech,” led by the Braille team, left us deeply optimistic as UX is one of the main attributes we pride ourselves on while designing the building platform for Web3 endeavors. Nino Kutnjak, CPO at Apillon, actively participated in what seems to be becoming a hot topic in the industry, UX- and accessibility-related debate.

Braille is a team of UX/UI experts on a mission to make the Polkadot ecosystem more approachable and intuitive. A more convenient and user-friendly interface is a must, especially if we want to provide seamless onboarding and lower the Web3 barrier for less-tech-savvy individuals who want to use Polkadot for its string of services and not solely for building.


The workshop was conducted so that teams could point out the biggest UX hurdles faced by Polkadot users. Once each team collected their choices, they presented those cases on the stage, bringing a broader awareness that many things could be refined to increase Polkadot's overall UX.


The primary purpose of the Braille initiative is to reach a broader community consensus regarding:


The workshop concluded with a clear commitment to kickstart the Polkadot UX initiative, which invited everyone from the ecosystem to participate in the debates that will soon follow.


A while ago, Nino wrote down some thoughts and his own UX/UI-related impressions; you can check through the main points here 👇

#### 3. In the backstage


Apillon’s Senior Backend Engineer, Damjan Dimitrov, gave a short interview for the Polkadot PromoTeam. Is there a more charming way to present the Apillon platform? Don’t think so. Check him out 👇

### The Apillon team — one jetlag away from every great Web3 conference


The team has had the pleasure — and a time zone change syndrome— of traveling almost around the whole globe in just three weeks.


First ETHDenver, now sub0 Asia—the most fruitful Polkadot events for Apillon. We are full-bellied, happy and pleased, maybe a bit tired. But most definitely immensely proud of all the progress we’ve made, all the changes we’ve incorporated, and all the fun that still awaits. ’Til the next one!

Now go and build your own Web3 block — you can tell us all about it when we meet at the next Polkadot event 👍
