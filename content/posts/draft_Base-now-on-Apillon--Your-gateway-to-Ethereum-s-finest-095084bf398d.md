Web3 is growing fast, and builders need tools that deliver tangible results —  not just the hype. And they need chains that will work for them and not the other way around. It is why Apillon keeps expanding its platform to offer developers smarter tools, better options, and fewer headaches.


We’re excited to welcome Base, an EVM-compatible solution, to the Apillon ecosystem. Designed for speed, scalability, and full Ethereum compatibility, Base will enable builders to scale projects faster, reduce costs and gain instant access to the audience of the finest decentralized platforms like OpenSea, Aave and Uniswap.


### What is Base?


Base is Coinbase’s Layer 2 (L2) blockchain solution, purpose-built to make Web3 more accessible for developers and users. Think of it as Ethereum’s faster, more affordable counterpart — designed to scale your projects without compromising security or reliability.


Built on the OP Stack with Optimism, Base uses optimistic rollups to process transactions off-chain before finalizing them on Ethereum. The result? Faster, cheaper operations that still benefit from Ethereum’s security.


By being part of the Superchain, Base isn’t just scaling Ethereum — it’s creating a seamless, interconnected Layer 2 ecosystem, where dapps can interact across chains with shared security and efficiency.


### Why Base? It just makes sense!


When choosing a blockchain for your projects, Base brings something unique to the table that can catapult your project miles ahead.


Here’s why Base is a no-brainer for builders on Apillon:


#### 1. Fast-track to the Ethereum ecosystem


Building on Base means instant access to Ethereum’s biggest platforms. Imagine creating a DeFi application that interacts with Uniswap for token trading or creating NFTs that integrate seamlessly with OpenSea. With Base, your project isn’t starting from scratch — it’s plugging into an ecosystem trusted by millions.


#### 2. Better scalability


Base can handle thousands of transactions per second, making it ideal for dapps with high user activity. The chain ensures your project runs smoothly, even at scale, whether it’s a gaming economy, NFT marketplace, or DeFi platform.


#### 3. Affordability at scale


Gas fees can make or break a project’s viability. On Base, transactions cost a fraction of what they would on Ethereum. This makes it the perfect choice for dapps that process large volumes of transactions — like NFT marketplaces or gaming economies.


#### 4. Seamless Coinbase integration


Base connects builders to Coinbase’s massive user base — 110M+ verified accounts and $80B in managed assets. With built-in fiat on-ramps and Coinbase’s reputation for security, it’s easier than ever to attract new users and drive adoption.


#### 5. No native token, no hassle


Base doesn’t introduce a new token. Instead, it sticks with ETH for gas fees, keeping things simple for both developers and users who don’t need to learn or adopt a new token.


#### 6. Cross-chain magic


Unlike many Layer 2 solutions, Base doesn’t isolate itself from the broader blockchain world. Instead, it’s built to interact with Ethereum and beyond, letting you bridge assets across chains like Avalanche, Polygon, or others.


#### 7. Funds and support


Base ecosystem funds and grants are available to you for applying for much-needed early-stage funding, win a weekly reward or receive extra gas credits to cover your users’ fees. The sky is the limit.

For Apillon, Base isn’t just a new chain — it’s a game-changer. It aligns perfectly with our mission to simplify blockchain development and empower builders to do what they do best: create.


### Base-supported services with real-world impact


On the Apillon platform, choosing the Base chain will be a game-changer for two key services: NFTs and smart contracts.


Picture this: You’re building a gaming app where players can trade in-game assets as NFTs. Or maybe you’re creating a DeFi platform that lets users swap tokens effortlessly and earn yields. With Base, you’re not just dreaming big — you’re building it.


All in all, Base isn’t just another Layer 2 chain. It’s your scalable, user-friendly upgrade to the vast Ethereum ecosystem — designed to power the next generation of decentralized applications.


### Apillon’s approach to multi-chain development


Multi-chain isn’t just a buzzword — it’s how Web3 moves forward. At Apillon, we believe in a future where developers don’t have to choose between chains — they can have it all.


Here’s how we make it easy:


### What’s next?


Our mission is simple: to make Web3 development as intuitive and accessible as possible. Every new chain we add represents a step forward for developers and for Web3 as a whole.


With Apillon, you can tap into the power of Base without the hassle. Ready to take your ideas to your next users and to the next level?
