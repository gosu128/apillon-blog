### Why decentralized storage for NFT metadata?


Short answer? Because you could be sorry otherwise.


The most common NFT types include some sort of media files, which cannot be stored on the blockchain due to their size. Such NFTs still depend on online storage to display images, videos, and other media files that make them memorable.


The crucial part here is how that online storage works. A centralized server could be shut down or have restricted access. The link to the asset could thus be broken or produce an error, leaving the contents that make up the asset — and render it non-fungible — useless, lost, or inaccessible.


That’s why storing the elements of an NFT in a decentralized manner, bypassing single points of attack, is crucial for their longevity, relevance and value. That goes particularly for NFT metadata, which holds an asset’s exact description on-chain that makes it unique and can’t be replicated — unlike the media file that could be copied and reused ad nauseam, parting from its non-fungible identity.

### Decentralized storage by Apillon


With Apillon, you can bring your NFT collection to a fully decentralized level, metadata storage included.


Apillon’s Web3 Storage service allows you to upload your NFT files to a decentralized storage bucket in a few clicks. The service is powered by Crust Network, a Polkadot parachain that serves IPFS connectivity and pins files to a global decentralized network of nodes.

Ok, let’s get started.


### Step 1: Create a Web3 Storage bucket


In the menu on the left, under Services, navigate to the Storage section to create a Web3 Storage bucket.


Click the New bucket button at the bottom of the page (if this is your first time using buckets) or in the top right corner (if you’re adding it to previously created buckets).


Then, name the new storage bucket to distinguish it from other-purpose storage buckets easily, add a description if you wish, and click Create bucket & continue to management.


### Step 2: Upload NFT metadata and media files


To bring your NFT metadata to your Web3 Storage bucket, simply use the drag and drop function or click on the Upload files and folders field to select them from your local drive.


In the low right corner, review the list of selected files, check the Wrap to directory option if you wish so, and click “Upload now”.


If you choose to wrap files in a directory, name the newly created folder to easily distinguish it from others and click “Upload”.


Once all files are successfully uploaded, they appear listed in your Web3 Storage bucket.


When you click on the folder name, a detailed list of files appears with detailed info, including File CID, Download link, File size, and Status — it should say Uploaded to IPFS.


If you wish to keep the files editable — particularly the NFT metadata file — so that you can update contents if needed, publish them to IPNS.


Go back to the Web3 Storage bucket where your recently uploaded files or folder are listed. Under the three dots on the right, click Publish to IPNS.


In the pop-up window, choose the IPNS record you’d like to upload to and click “Publish to IPNS” or create a new IPNS record.


In moments, your NFT files are uploaded to IPNS — you can find more details, including the IPNS name and link, under the IPNS tab. If the site doesn’t update soon, click “Refresh”.


Click on the IPNS link to see all the linked files uploaded to IPNS.


Now your NFT metadata and all the uploaded media files live decentrally on IPFS, unstoppable from third-party impact, and accessible as long as you or other users have a link to them.


### Step 3: Deploy NFT smart contract


Now, to bring your NFTs with decentrally stored metadata to life, navigate to the NFT section in the Services menu on the left.


Click New NFT collection.


To deploy your NFT smart contract, you can go with either Moonbeam Network or Astar.


Follow the guides below based on your choice and launch your NFT collection in an end-to-end decentralized fashion using a click-through approach.
