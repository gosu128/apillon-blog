### Recap: Authtrail at BlockSplit 3 conference


#### Authtrail team attended the BlockSplit 3 conference and presented its vision at the region’s largest blockchain and crypto event.


This year’s live BlockSplit 3 international conference on blockchain business and development was held between May 23 and 25. The region’s largest conference for the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry provided a perfect opportunity to share the knowledge and experience in Web3 with fresh talents, network, and grow the blockchain community. Among many international attendees, there was also Authtrail’s team.

### Networking at BlockSplit 3 was a blast


A sold-out 3-day event, hosted in the beautiful city of Split, Croatia, brought together blockchain startups, developers, researchers, investors, marketers, and designers who want to stay on top of blockchain development and advocate its adoption to wider audiences. With more than 600 participants and over 50 speakers, we had a great opportunity to catch up and network with colleagues all around Europe and UK.


There were hands-on workshops held on May 23, while the business and development program kept Authtrail’s team busy on May 24 and 25. Two parallel tracks provided presentations and lectures by some of the industry’s leading experts and covered some of the hottest and most discussed topics, such as DeFi, NFT, regulations in blockchain in crypto, DAOs, etc.

### Authtrail’s presentation inspired the crowd


Authtrail’s work and vision were presented on Day 2 of the conference — CEO Matjaž Sobocan‘s talk on How enterprises use blockchain to build better businesses? took the audience through the evolution path from Web1 to Web3. He explained how Web3 adoption could spearhead business development and help with transparency and trustworthiness while companies keep ownership of the processed data.

The need for Web3 development is there, and evolving ecosystem is promising the creation of a better web. All Web3 projects strive to support and improve their infrastructure. Authtrail is also one of those that will continue to boost the adoption of blockchain in the enterprise sphere and among the developers who are still hesitant about joining the Web3 niche.
