### FAQ: Apillon’s proposal to promote Web3 adoption as an open-source infrastructure on Polkadot


#### Any questions about Apillon’s Polkadot Bounty proposal? Here’s a breakdown of the most essential points.


The Apillon Bounty Proposal, updated and upgraded, is now live on Polkassembly, awaiting your vote.

### How did we go about it?


On June 19, on the encouragement of the key ecosystem stakeholders, Apillon submitted a discussion to back the OpenGov proposal for Treasury funding.

We dived into the immense feedback we’ve received and used the inclusive approach to craft, rewrite and re-design the proposal which resonated very well with stakeholders.

The recent alterations made to the Apillon Proposal are about the mechanisms that would ensure more power to the community and a more structured and curated way of Bounty funding. Here is a breakdown of the changes.

With Polkadot funding and community support, the Apillon platform would transition to an open-source product with permanent freemium access and community governance. By becoming a common good project, Apillon would help spur Web3 adoption, Polkadot ecosystem growth, and DOT utility.


Here are the most frequent questions and answers to help you navigate and understand the weight of the proposal.

[Common good and open-source approach](#f1d3)
[Proposal: Apillon, Polkadot, and the Web3 sphere](#aa60)
[The Apillon platform](#9392)

### Common good and open-source approach


Polkadot’s common good and open-source approach aims to innovate services that benefit projects and users across the whole ecosystem.


With many new protocol-layer projects regularly developed on Polkadot, the ecosystem is in dire need of an application-layer solution that would allow developers to easily onboard the Polkadot ecosystem and bring Web3 to a mainstream level.


#### Why would Apillon transition to a common good solution?


With Apillon transforming into a common good solution, the Polkadot ecosystem would get a forever-freemium Web3 development platform. Every new user on the Apillon platform would mean a new developer for Polkadot, boosting the adoption of Web3 technologies. Through DOT-based governance, Polkadot’s native token would get another utility boost and purpose in driving the network’s adoption.


With decentralized governance, existing and new platform users would get to decide on parachain integrations and the evolution of the Apillon platform, thus collaboratively innovating the future of Web3.


Apillon would make a strong commitment to the community and the ecosystem to achieve the set milestones, spend resources as described in the Proposal, and pursue the vision of the developer community. The set of five curators will have a say in those milestones being achieved and only then will the funds be on their way to Apillon.


### Proposal: Apillon, Polkadot, and the Web3 sphere


#### What are the main points of Apillon’s Proposal?


Apillon’s Proposal for Polkadot’s Treasury funding seeks community support to transform into an open-source infrastructure on Polkadot.


The funding would have the following direct consequences on Apillon:

[Proposal](https://ipfs.apillon.io/ipfs/QmZmZLdpeuVN9vpw3WNzJh8F62vzqwZDmrXdh5mBRB1GVh)

#### What business model for Apillon does the proposal foresee?


With operational costs covered by the Bounty for two years, Apillon would be able to incentivize developers with freemium plans at no additional fees.


After the end of the two-year period, Apillon would introduce a price margin on top of parachain service cost. However, this would be non-profitable and controlled via governance, allowing the Apillon team to survive on fees to keep the project alive and in the best possible shape.


Apillon’s Treasury-backed transition to open-source presents a strong obligation toward the community. Therefore, The Freemium plan will remain permanently or until the project’s governance decides otherwise.


#### What does Apillon bring to Polkadot as a common good project?


The Apillon platform would further improve the Polkadot ecosystem and the Web3 space with:


#### How would an open-source development platform benefit developers and other stakeholders outside the Polkadot ecosystem?


Easier, faster, and cheaper Web3 development would bring developers and other stakeholders:


#### How would Apillon address its current centralized points?


In the current stage, three main pillars of Apillon would require the implementation of decentralized control:


#### What would Apillon governance look like?


With DOT-based governance, the developer community would be able to co-decide the development direction of the Apillon platform, making it more agile in addressing market demands.


Apillon’s product governance would address questions such as:


The Apillon governance model is designed to run on the OpenGov mechanism, an upgraded decentralized governance system for Kusama and Polkadot.

### The Apillon platform


#### What is Apillon?


Apillon is a Web3 development platform that allows developers of all ranks to create Web3 projects.


Primarily, it supports Web3 development in the Polkadot ecosystem, though in its essence remains blockchain-agnostic. It gives access to Web3 services, abstracted decentralized functionalities powered by Polkadot parachains, and delivered in a familiar UI environment. These ready-to-use, few-click Web3 modules can be combined to power multi-chain Web3 projects.


Moreover, simple API connectivity to the supported parachains, CLIs, and SDKs allows for the easy creation of decentralized applications using only Web2 programming knowledge and skills.


Apillon applies Web3 technology following the Web2 logic.


#### What is the mission of Apillon?


Apillon is a small team following a big vision — to boost Web3 adoption by making the transition from Web2 to Web3 and Polkadot technologies easier for all developers.

[Why does Web3 need a unified development platform?To boost the adoption of Web3 solutions and make them accessible to every developer, Web3 needs a common building…blog.apillon.io](https://blog.apillon.io/why-does-web3-need-a-unified-development-platform-ca09a1cf2dbb)

#### How does Apillon work?


Apillon abstracts away the complex code of individual Polkadot parachains and transforms their core functionalities into Web3 services. This enables developers to create Web3 projects using multiple decentralized services in one project.


Developers can use APIs, SDKs, and other familiar developer tools to source Polkadot parachains, and customize the code to the needs of their project. For the less code-savvy users, the few-click building approach delivers decentralized features in minutes.

#### What does the Apillon platform offer?


The current version of Apillon provides three fully-fledged Web3 services that harness the powerful technologies and features of Polkadot parachains.


Developers can create decentralized projects using Web3 Storage and Web3 Hosting, powered by Crust Network, and easily launch NFT collections on the Moonbeam or the Astar networks.
