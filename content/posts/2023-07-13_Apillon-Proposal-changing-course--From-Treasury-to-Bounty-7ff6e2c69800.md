### Apillon Proposal changing course: From Treasury toÂ Bounty


#### The Polkadot community raised a few legitimate concerns regarding the Proposal; hence some structural changes were made to the fundingÂ scheme.


As a strong advocate for community building and Polkadot ecosystem collaboration, the Apillon team decided to follow the path aligned with the backersâ€™ preferenceâ€Šâ€”â€Ša pivot onto the Bounty road to enhance community overview, governance power, and co-ownership.


Throughout proposal fine-tuning, the team engaged in countless dialogues at live events, online deliberations, and debates with ecosystem alliances (ChaosDAO, Polka HÃ¤us, just to name a few), as well as preliminary discussions on Polkassembly and Polkadot Forumâ€Šâ€”â€Šall dissecting Apillonâ€™s transition to an open-source infrastructure on Polkadot and its impact on the space.

Thanks to community engagement and invaluable feedback, we kept our finger on the pulse and got a clear sense of the general sentiment. We sat down to systematically address second thoughts and pain points and, ultimately, adjusted the Proposal to respect all gathered remarks.


ðŸ‘‰ The change: Apillon Proposal moves from Treasury to Bounty section.


### Bounty funding to reward pastÂ work


Changing course in the Polkadot funding schemes brings the following:


Every other aspect of the Proposal remains as is.


Itâ€™s a teamâ€™s work. Ecosystem growth even more so.


We are truly grateful for all the feedback garnered in the past weeksâ€Šâ€”â€Šit has been both extensive and beneficial.


On the way to true decentralization, the Web3 communities have established pathways to communicate their needs and created incentives to secure them. It is only right for ecosystem catalysts to pay attention, respect what they have to say and adjust accordingly.

[How ecosystem engagement helped steer the way of the Apillon ProposalA mere week has passed since the Parachain Summit and Polkadot Decoded events in Copenhagen, where we had theâ€¦blog.apillon.io](https://blog.apillon.io/how-ecosystem-engagement-helped-steer-the-way-of-the-apillon-proposal-93af9f568fdb)

The discussion remains open on Polkassembly and Polkadot Forum until early next week, and we invite everyone to join in and share their views on the remodel of our Proposal. Every feedback counts.
