For those who already know why IPFS is the file-sharing protocol of the future, letâ€™s dive right into the general costs of the IPFS pinning service and how to easily use it for free with Apillon.


### Is IPFS uploadÂ free?


Considering IPFS is an open-source file-sharing protocol, you might wonder: Is IPFS upload free? Technically, yes.


IPFS is an open network of IPFS nodes, which are essentially the computers that participate in the network. They can communicate with each other while they store and share bits of your uploaded content.


If you want to upload files to IPFS to get decentralized storage for your content or decentralized hosting for your websites, you can do so for free. But your computer will need to become one of the nodes in the IPFS network.


If you donâ€™t want that, youâ€™ll need to find a decentralized storage provider that offers the infrastructure on top of the IPFS protocol layer.


### Where can you get freeÂ IPFS?


There are several decentralized storage providers out there that support the IPFS protocol.


Some IPFS storage providers even offer you to upload files to IPFS at a very, very low cost. You can even upload an entire directory, not just files.


One of them is Crust Network, which currently powers decentralized Storage and Hosting services on the Apillon platform. Crust is a decentralized cloud storage provider based on IPFS.

But the problem why most people donâ€™t get started with decentralized storage and hosting isnâ€™t even the cost, itâ€™s the complexity.
