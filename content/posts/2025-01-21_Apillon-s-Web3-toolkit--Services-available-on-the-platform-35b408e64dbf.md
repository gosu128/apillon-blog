No more asking customers to figure out crypto — this feature keeps things smooth and frustration-free.


Imagine: You run a crowdfunding platform where users can focus on backing projects instantly, with no setup required and no passwords involved. Embedded wallets make that a reality.

### RPC service — smooth blockchain connectivity


Your app’s connection to the blockchain shouldn’t be a pain point. Apillon’s RPC (Remote Procedure Call) service makes accessing and interacting with blockchain data seamless and reliable. It’s the steady lifeline your app needs to deliver real-time updates without breaking a sweat.

### Web3 Authentication — seamless and secure


In the digital age, verifying identities shouldn’t be a maze of passwords and security questions. Apillon’s authentication service brings decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials to your fingertips. Users can prove who they are without surrendering personal data to centralized entities.


Picture this: Develop a decentralized voting app where users authenticate in seconds using their unique DIDs, ensuring a smooth, secure, and private voting experience.
