### What is a Polkadot wallet?


Digital wallets are tools that allow users to perform transactions on a blockchain network, be it making payments or transferring assets. Polkadot wallet is, therefore, a tool, a digital system, that lets you authorize transactions on the Polkadot network.


With Polkadot wallets, you can transfer funds or data from one digital wallet to another or authorize actions on platforms and dapps that support or require connectivity with the Polkadot network.


Apillon supports connectivity with non-custodial Polkadot wallets, allowing you to access the Polkadot ecosystem and the Apillon platform directly from your browser while maintaining control over your private keys and providing a solid user experience while doing it.

### Why Polkadot wallet connectivity?


In the current phase, a linked Polkadot wallet represents one of the ways you can log in to your existing Apillon account.

As the Apillon platform evolves, it plans to harness Polkadot wallet capabilities to enable direct interaction with parachains, asset transfer, on-chain payments, and ownership of assets and smart contracts deployed via Apillon. So far, we’ve decided to go with three of the best Polkadot wallets to provide connectivity to the platform.


### Polkadot wallets supported by Apillon


In its current state, the Apillon platform supports connectivity to the three most commonly used Polkadot browser extension wallets:

[Polkadot{.js}](#f2cd)
[SubWallet](#335a)
[Talisman](#1ed5)

#### Polkadot-JS​

[​](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/polkadotjs#polkadot-js-extension)

More than a wallet, the Polkadot-JS extension for your browser lets you manage multiple accounts, import or export them, and even restore lost accounts.

With the Polkadot{.js} browser extension, you can sign and authorize transactions/actions on the Polkadot network, but you cannot send and receive funds. It also allows you to interact with extension-compliant dapps, such as the Polkadot-JS UI, the native application for accessing features available on Substrate chains as Polkadot and Kusama.

#### SubWallet


SubWallet is a non-custodial wallet for Polkadot, Substrate, Ethereum, and other ecosystems. By providing connectivity to more than 150+ networks, it allows you to transfer and monitor assets and data across multiple Web3 worlds.

### How to connect your Polkadot wallet on Apillon?


Connecting to your Polkadot wallet from your Apillon dashboard is a matter of a few clicks. You only need your wallet of choice installed and logged in.


Now, go to your Apillon dashboard, click on your avatar icon in the top right corner, and choose Profile. Scroll down towards the bottom of the page and find Connect wallet.

[Apillon dashboard](https://app.apillon.io/login)

Click the “Connect wallet” button, and in the pop-up window, choose the Polkadot wallet you want to connect to, either Polkadot{.js}, SubWallet, or Talisman.


Apillon only establishes connectivity to a Substrate-based account, so make sure your wallet is connected to the right network or switch networks if needed.


The process is the same for all supported wallets, but let’s see it step by step for each of them. You can shorten the path and connect the Polkadot{.js} browser extension, SubWallet wallet extension, and Talisman wallet extension to your browser.


#### Polkadot{.js}


To connect the Polkadot{.js} browser extension wallet, choose it on the list and click the “Connect wallet” button.


When the Polkadot{.js} pop-up window appears, authorize connection by entering the password and click “Sign the message”.


Soon after, your wallet should be connected to your Apillon dashboard.


#### SubWallet


To connect SubWallet, choose it on the Connect wallet list, and click the “Connect wallet” button.


Approve the transaction in the SubWallet pop-up window by entering the password and clicking “Approve”.


There, your SubWallet should be connected to Apillon in seconds.


#### Talisman


And, if you prefer Talisman, simply choose it on the list of wallets, click “Connect wallet”, and “Approve” in the Talisman pop-up window.


Voilà, your Talisman wallet is linked to your Apillon dashboard.


#### Account log in using Polkadot wallet


As mentioned earlier, Polkadot wallet log in is, in its current phase, only available to users that have already linked their existing accounts with a Polkadot wallet.


After logging out from your Apillon account, you can log in again using only your Polkadot wallet. On the home page, click the “Log in with wallet” button, choose the linked wallet, and authorize the transaction in the wallet’s pop-up window.


That’s it. You can log in to your Apillon account using your Polkadot wallet.


### Gateway to Polkadot


With the latest feature, Apillon lets you link your Polkadot wallet for an easy account log in and more unlocked capabilities in the platform’s future releases.


Go to your Apillon account and establish direct connectivity with Polkadot.
