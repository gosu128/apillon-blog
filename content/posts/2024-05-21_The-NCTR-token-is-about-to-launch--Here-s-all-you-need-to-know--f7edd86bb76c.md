### The countdown begins


It’s finally here. The token generation event (TGE) of Apillon’s native NCTR token is scheduled for late May 2024.


Along with the preset distribution scheme (outlined down below), Apillon will also issue special bonuses and giveaways to thank our community for their unwavering support.


But first, let’s recap where Apillon stands at the moment and where it came from.


#### The metamorphosis of Apillon


Most Apillon community members are familiar with the rebranding from Authtrail to Apillon and the product direction shift that came with it. In the context of TGE, the shift is worth noticing — the community of Authtrail’s AUT token backers now represents early contributors (Pre-Seed) in the upcoming Apillon’s NCTR token TGE.

Today, Apillon’s position within the Polkadot ecosystem, its path to product maturity, and the growing number of users demonstrate its relevance in the field and the bright future ahead.


Currently, Apillon positions itself as a Web3 SaaS development platform offering the following production-ready features:

The comprehensive list of integrations and features did not materialize overnight. They stem from diligent teamwork spanning coding, marketing, and networking efforts, which opened doors to various Polkadot-based solutions and provided the necessary support for technical integration.


Readily available Apillon features have attracted thousands of users, boosting activity on supported parachains through the roof and solidifying the platform’s role in the Polkadot space.

Now, where does the NCTR token come in?


### NCTR utilities


The NCTR token is a multi-purpose and widely used asset, covering a range of utility cases for the Apillon platform users and community members.


NCTR token utilities can be split into three main categories, namely governance, incentivization and payments.


The governance aspect is focused on the product, i.e., the Apillon platform, and its narrow scope of user-oriented services and features that participants can help control and upgrade.


The second pillar of NCTR utility is aimed at incentivizing tokenomics actors in various ways while promoting Web3 adoption.


Finally, the NCTR token serves as a payment vehicle for Apillon platform services, complementing card-based fiat payments.


Overall, the NCTR token serves various purposes and enables various utilities catering to both platform users and token holders.

But first, get ready for its launch.


### NCTR token generation event (TGE)


#### Launch date


The Apillon team will execute the token generation event (TGE) in late May, as promised.


The target date of token genesis and generation of the full NCTR supply under Apillon’s control is May 29, 2024, at the latest.


#### Launch parameters


In the context of generating and releasing a token, a number of factors impact its trajectory and reception on the market. Understanding them is crucial to see the bigger picture of NCTR’s positioning among other assets.


Some events are entirely in Apillon’s control and will be performed as such:


However, some things cannot be influenced beyond a certain level, the main being NCTR’s listing on a major exchange.


The listing of NCTR token is in the process of being approved on three major exchanges, including a Tier 1 CEX. Tier 1 exchanges currently delay new token listings, with the exception of previously signed contracts. Besides, the Tier 1 exchange Apillon has been negotiating with has not yet provided estimates on the listing date for NCTR — it could happen within one to two months from now, in Autumn, or can even be subject to last-moment rejection. On the other hand, Tier 2 or Tier 3 exchanges enable token listing a month after signing the contract.


In general, the vetting process linked to token listing on a CEX is not only extremely expensive but also delivers zero guarantees. To ensure the best outcome and opportunities for the Apillon team and the community, the token launch was adjusted accordingly.


Instead of spending another year convincing CEXs to list NCTR, the token will be generated and released to the community through a different path while the Tier 1 CEX listing efforts will strengthen again in the future.


#### Launch roadmap


Within the broader context of generating Apillon’s native NCTR token, the adjusted launch roadmap is as follows:

[NCTR Airdrop](https://apillon.io/airdrop)

#### DEX listings


It is important to note that the above token launch roadmap is not just a back-up option. Discussions with peer Polkadot projects and market makers have revealed the following good practices to ensure long-term token price health:


Another benefit of starting small on HydraDX and Stellaswap is the fact that both DEXes recently received 1 million DOT from Polkadot’s Opengov Treasury to boost DOT liquidity, turning them into valuable volume competitors against smaller CEXes. NCTR has a significant opportunity to tap into the increased volume and traffic generated by a growing number of HydraDX and Stellaswap traders.


Regardless of the initial launch scope, Apillon will continue to pursue the CEX listing route in the following months, utilizing the trading pair volumes on DEXes to back the CEX application arguments.


The time to launch NCTR and bring it to early backers is optimal, as the Apillon platform boasts significant traction on the market, and the token’s utilities have matured to satisfy community demand.


#### Technical capabilities


Previously, NCTR was supposed to be minted on Astar or Moonbeam. However, after researching the networks’ interoperability capabilities and re-evaluation of best TGE practices, the Apillon team has decided to mint the NCTR on the AssetHub common-good parachain and, from there, move it to Moonbeam, making Moonbeam the primary network for NCTR distribution.


This kind of approach utilizes most of Polkadot’s amazing interoperability functionalities, makes the NCTR token easily swappable between several parachains, and allows NCTR to reach beyond Polkadot to EVM-compatible chains via sophisticated bridging.


We can proudly say that despite technical challenges, all of the targeted bridging scenarios on testnet were thoroughly evaluated and tested. Apillon can thus confidently launch the NCTR token as planned and capable of standing the test of time through interoperability by design.


To recap:


### NCTR goes live, then what?


#### Genesis NCTR allocation


The total supply of NCTR at its launch will be 150 million, 1.35% of which (2,083,000 NCTR) will be allocated to the participants in Polimec-based Crowdsale.

[Polimec-based Crowdsale](https://apillon.io/crowdsale/)

The majority of NCTR supply is reserved for early supporters (Pre-Seed). A big chunk will also be allocated to the Developer Adoption Fund (over 46 million NCTR) to boost the adoption of Apillon, integrated partners, and underlying technologies of Polkadot and parachains.


#### Early contributors, pools, and AUT backers


All early contributors, pools and other AUT (Authtrail) backers are eligible to receive NCTR tokens in the same amount as promised in the AUT Pre-Seed round.


No deals have changed except for the token ticker, which has changed from AUT to NCTR following the product rebrand.


Besides, all early contributors (i.e., except NCTR Crowdsale and Airdrop participants) will receive NCTR tokens as per their round deals and a +15% NCTR bonus as compensation for their patience in the token launch.


#### Incentivization through NCTR


The genesis NCTR token allocation has a slight change compared to the AUT allocation.


The main change stems from the creation of the Developer Adoption Fund, where nearly a third of the NCTR supply would incentivize user acquisition, development and adoption of the platform and supported technologies, ultimately leading to greater exposure in the emerging Web3 market. Large incentivization pools proved to be the driving force behind token value in projects like Arbitrum, Blur and others.


At the same time, the Apillon platform is upgrading to an open-source level. This typically relies on a larger audience, not only a few individuals. Expanding the audience of NCTR holders is, therefore, key to mobilizing the immense ecosystem of Web3 open-source developers who aim to improve products through bounties and expand their functionalities.


In this scenario, NCTR directly rewards everyone who contributes to an improved product offering.


It goes without saying that a heavy incentivization fund comes with a large responsibility. The majority of incentivization NCTR will be distributed fully transparently with the help of the community through NCTR Governance. Everyone holding or having locked NCTR will be able to participate in decentralized governance to vote, review proposals, decide on releasing NCTR into circulation and be rewarded for doing so.


#### Utilities — enabled


Once the NCTR token is distributed, Apillon will open the gates to community governance on the Townhall platform. Townhall will serve as the primary channel for NCTR holders to participate in incentivized governance and co-govern Apillon’s product scope.


Next, the Apillon platform will integrate NCTR as a primary payment vehicle, creating a clear NCTR demand on the market and potentially affecting the demand volume.


The token will further facilitate utilities targeted at non-developers, including incentivization to earn more NCTR. To learn more about how to farm NCTR, please refer to Apillon’s Tokenomics Whitepaper.
