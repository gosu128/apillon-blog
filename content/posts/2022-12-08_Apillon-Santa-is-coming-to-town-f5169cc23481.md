### Apillon Santa is coming to town


#### ’Tis the season for the holiday giveaway — Apillon’s first big merch party will pay tribute to all the progress made on the Apillon platform so far. Let’s celebrate together, dressed in the exquisite Apillon merch.


Apillon changes the way developers think and build the decentralized future. With its Web3 development platform, Apillon makes the transition to Web3 within reach, be it for Web2 developers keen on some Web3 project making or Web3 devs who already know their way around the vast Polkadot universe.


Join in on our journey and get the chance to win a Christmas present in the form of Apillon’s merch bundle. Or should we say stocking?


### How to get in the mix for Apillon swag?


Follow the steps below:

### With a bit of luck... the Apillon merch pack can be yours


Snow time like the present! Time is ticking away — you have exactly one week to follow through with the steps described above — on Friday, December 16, 2022, 20 winners will be drawn.


All lucky champions will be asked to provide further details via email so they can receive a special gift from Apillon before Christmas — to put under the tree or to simply look awesome at Christmas dinner with your friends and family.


What do you say, do we get a round of Santa-pplause?
