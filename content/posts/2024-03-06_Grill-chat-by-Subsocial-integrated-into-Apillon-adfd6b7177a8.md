Creating a decentralized app is a skill in itself, but allowing your community to grow within it adds another dimension to its autonomy and relevance in the Web3 society.


And what better way than incorporating a fully decentralized chat room that reinforces your Web3 stance and allows your users to retain control over their social accounts?


Enter Grill.chat by Subsocial.


Now, with Apillon integration, you can spin up a custom Web3-based chat channel for your dapp in minutes.


### Why Subsocial’s Grill.chat?

But Grill.chat’s social reach spans beyond its native URL — and this is what Apillon’s integration is all about. Its high-speed on-chain chat room functionality can be integrated into any existing application for users to communicate with one another while they interact with the site.


With Grill.chat on Apillon, you too can transform your dapp into a social experience and boost your audience’s engagement without directing them to third-party social channels.


There are several benefits such an integration could bring:


### Get social with Grill.chat on Apillon


With Grill.chat functionality provided on the Apillon platform, you can bring Web3 chat room to your dapp even faster.


Apillon takes care of the complete blockchain configuration, payments, and other complexities. The only thing left for you to do is to bring it to your dapp’s front end.


Before diving into Grill.chat for real, take a look at the Demo to get a general idea.


### Grill.chat integration, step-by-step


To enable Grill.chat functionality for your dapp, follow the steps below:


#### Hub and channel setup


1. Log into your account on the Apillon dashboard.

[Apillon dashboard](https://app.apillon.io/login)

2. In the menu on the left, under Web3 Services, navigate to Social. Click the “Create first hub” button.


3. When a pop-up window opens, enter your hub name. If you wish, you can also add a description and tags to distinguish it from other hubs you might want to create in the future.


4. Now, your hub is being deployed on chain, as shown by its Draft status. The deployment could take a few minutes, so please be patient.


5. Once your hub is deployed and its status changes from Draft to Active, you can view details by clicking directly on the Hub name on the hub list or clicking “View” under the three dots on the right.


6. Now, you can create a New channel inside your social hub. Click the “New channel” button on top right.


7. In the pop-up, enter your newly created channel’s title, content, and, optionally, equip it with tags. Click “Create channel”.


8. The channel is now being deployed, as shown by the Draft status.


9. Once your channel is active, you can see it on the right-hand side, where you can log in using different methods.


Now it’s time to configure the settings.


#### Configuration


There are two ways to configure the Grill.chat widget on your website or dapp. One for the whole hub and the other for only a specific channel.


1. Hub configuration


With this method, you can integrate the whole Grill.chat-provided hub into your dapp. Since a hub can cover multiple channels, your community will be able to further navigate and choose among all the channels you created under that hub.


In the top right corner, click “Show hub settings”, follow and customize the config details that appear in the pop-up window.


2. Channel configuration


Alternatively, you can just integrate a specific Grill.chat channel to your website or dapp.


On the list of channels, click either the right-facing arrow on the left or “Select channel” under the three dots on the right.


These will expand the details of the channel, which includes configuration settings for you to use in your dapp’s back end.


That’s it! You can now invite your community to engage through Grill.chat — either hub or channel — on your dapp and boost its social value.


#### All things covered — payments included


Grill.chat operates using Subsocial’s SUB token. Users who want to create hubs or channels need those tokens or energy, which can be received by burning SUB tokens.


However, if you integrate Grill.chat over Apillon, you’re spared the hassle of handling the financial aspect of either acquiring SUB tokens or converting them to energy. Apillon handles all the underlying payments in the back end.


To use Grill.chat on production, you simply need enough Apillon credits. Get started, create an account on Apillon, and receive free credits to build your dapp’s social hub.
