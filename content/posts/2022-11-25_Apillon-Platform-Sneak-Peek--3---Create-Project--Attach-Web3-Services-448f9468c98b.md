### Apillon Platform Sneak Peek #3â€Šâ€”â€ŠCreate Project, Attach Web3Â Services


#### Discover how you will be able to create a project powered by Web3 services, Apillonâ€™s connectivity options, and advanced management settings.


In previous sneak peeks, we went from registration to the Apillon platform to the first steps through the Apillon dashboard.

### Attach Services


On your Apillon dashboard, on top of the menu on the left, you will see Project overview.


On the main screen, under Resources, the [Attach a service] button will take you to the part where you can start turning ideas into Web3 products.


In Apillon Beta, you will be able to create Web3 projects by attaching the following services:

[KILT Protocol](https://kilt.io)
[Crust Network](https://crust.network)

The following service to be attached to the Apillon platform will be Web3 Computing by Phala Network.

After clicking the [Attach service] button, your chosen service will be configured and become fully operational in your Web3 project.


After attaching a service, you should set its name to distinguish it from other elements of your project powered by the same service. Also, you should choose whether to configure it on a test or live network. You will be able to change network settings later.


The supported services will power individual features of your Web3 product. On the right side of the dashboard, the list of supported Client Libraries will be shown for each service.


Once your preferred services are attached, you will be able to monitor their Status (Active or Paused) and Uptime, or Manage them further.


Now, off to the management part.


### Manage Services


To fine-tune how the attached services power your Web3 project, you should optimize its settings.


You will be able to manage and monitor your projectâ€™s services through:


Since most of them are self-explanatory, letâ€™s take a closer look only at Methods and API keys.


#### Methodsâ€Šâ€”â€ŠWeb3 orÂ Web2


Under Methods, you will be able to navigate through both Web3 or Web2 methods and activate them depending on whether you want to combine blockchain-based features with centralized services within the same project.


This would allow you to set up and customize the range of methods for the attached services in your project.


#### API keys


In the API keys section, you will be able to use the APIs and keys that link to your attached service.


API keys represent the way your Web3 project communicates with Apillon and subsequently performs actions on integrated parachains. You could generate API keys for the whole project or a specific service. You will also be able to manage existing keys and access, allowing for granular project architecture, and later to monitor project expenses.


Thanks to API-based access to Web3 services, youâ€™ll be able to simply connect and code the rest of the matter in minutes using standard programming knowledge.


The Apillon platform is designed to maintain and upgrade the integrated Web3 services automatically, so you wonâ€™t have to constantly check up on them to keep your Web3 project up and running as it should.


Thatâ€™s it, weâ€™ve come to the end of the final sneak peek into the Apillon platform. For more updates on the platform release, follow the publication or learn more on the Apillon website.
