Calling all Web3 action players and bug-slaying heroes! Apillon is rolling out the Bug Bounty program, where you’ll get the first crack at testing shiny new features and comment on all the services already in action by giving real-deal feedback and pocketing NCTR tokens along the way.


It’s not just a bounty — it’s your chance to help Apillon create the most UX-friendly Web3 experience for developers and users.
