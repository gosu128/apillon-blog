#### The bigger picture


MENT Ljubljana Festival stands out as one of the most attended festivals in the CEE region. It is famous for bringing together crème de la crème of contemporary pop music performers every year.


This year's decennial was a great chance to top up their regular reward programs and praise the community and all the avid fans of the arts, music, and the institution of the festival.


While MENT was intrigued to step into the Web3 realm — and it wasn’t even their first time — they didn’t want to alienate the audience with some high-tech no-one-knows-how-it-works treats.


Well, what can be written in eternity and (re)used in the future, just like fantastic music and inspiring art? And what makes simple yet power-packed bonuses that are easy on the eyes? Yes, that would be NFTs!


#### Problem: Lack of lasting loyalty programs to enhance attendee engagement


The primary purpose of this year’s MENT rewards was to interconnect both physical and digital realms of art and music and equip them with valuable benefits for the next generations and “for the shape of MENT to come”.


To still get in on the hype but not let the new technology take the main stage, the idea of the MENT token was born — a safe balance between the old way of distributing rewards and the new, decentralized way of equipping said rewards with permanent bonuses to reward the loyal audience.

#### Web3 onboarding made easy


When implementing a new-wave technology to drive business success, keeping the comforting old way of using it is crucial.


In the case of MENT, keeping the Web2 way of engaging with the audience and visitors but enhancing the experience with Web3 benefits turned out to be the way to go.
