### Polkadot OpenGov simplifies and democratizes the on-chain voting process


#### With the community in full control of the network, Polkadot OpenGov is the first decentralized, unstoppable, and open governance platform.


The blockchain community needs a strong and functional governance process for a variety of reasons. A frictionless governance structure enables the community to decide how to develop projects, how to fund and rollout frequent updates to stay relevant, effective, and secure, and how to manage issues in a timely manner.


Until now, Polkadot’s governance structure vaguely resembled a parliamentary democracy. Unlike in many other blockchain communities, the governance process is performed on-chain, providing a high level of transparency. This system has worked rather well for the first years of operation.


However, despite its high level of transparendy and efficiency, Polkadot’s original governance structure had its drawbacks and it was always meant to evolve over time. And that time has come. The next-gen governance is already live on Kusama, coming to Polkadot once rigorously tested.


In this blog, we’ll cover what are the main changes brought on by the new OpenGov, initially called Gov2.
