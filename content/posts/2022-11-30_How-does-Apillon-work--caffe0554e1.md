### How does Apillon¬†work?


#### Apillon delivers Web3 functionalities powered by Polkadot parachains through straightforward API access, ample SDKs, and complete documentation for each¬†service.


Web3 is complex. Its development shouldn‚Äôt be.


The solutions brought by Polkadot parachains are extremely powerful in addressing specific use cases, such as digital authentication and identity, decentralized computing, decentralized storage, etc.

[decentralized computing](https://www.phala.network/)
[decentralized storage](https://crust.network/)

However, apart from their common underlying infrastructure, they lack shared access. Developers who decide to build a Web3 product implementing just one parachain technology ‚Äúonly‚Äù need to master its specific set of rules and technology stack. But what if they want to integrate two or more? Developing such a product the long way is not just a toll on developers‚Äô time and resources but also introduces high complexity to the project‚Äôs infrastructure.

### Web3 services the Web2¬†way


Apillon abstracts the technological complexity behind the Polkadot network and its parachains into a suite of development tools. It respects the standard ways developers build applications, allowing them to upgrade to Web3 easily.


The Apillon platform gathers and delivers Web3 functionalities powered by Polkadot parachains through straightforward API access, ample SDKs, and complete documentation for each service.


Its easy access and interoperability allow builders to combine use cases and integrate them seamlessly into conglomerates of distributed services, serving their audiences more thoroughly than they could with niche products.


### APIs to Polkadot parachains


Apillon APIs are easily integrated into any development framework. They introduce a new way of Web3 development that significantly simplifies the go-to-market evolution of a Web3 project.


Initially, the Apillon Beta platform will incorporate APIs to:

[KILT Protocol](https://www.kilt.io/)
[Crust Network](https://crust.network/)

In later versions, the platform will be upgraded to provide API access to Phala Network and its Web3 Computing service.

#### SDKs


Easing the integration of the Apillon platform and its APIs, ample SDKs enable faster and more streamlined utilization of Polkadot/Kusama parachains from the first click onwards.


#### Documentation


Guiding developers through the individual modules and dapp development process, Apillon documentation helps avoid the occurrence of bugs, mitigates operational issues, and creates working products with a lower risk of error and less need for auditing.


#### Monitoring


With a real-time overview of back-end performance, developers gain valuable insights into the functioning of their Web3 applications and attached services, allowing them to improve on lagging features or tweak the product for better performance.


#### Analytics


To help advance the adoption of Web3 products, Apillon‚Äôs Analytics delivers clear insight into UI and transaction data, allowing developers to understand how their products are used, their best-performing features, and areas that need improvement.

### Ordinary development for extraordinary solutions


With Apillon, every developer can build Web3 products.


Your standard web development knowledge and fluency in the most common programming languages (Javascript/Typescript, Python, etc.) will do the job.


The hard work of establishing a connection to Web3 service providers and their technologies on a single dashboard is done by the Apillon team.
