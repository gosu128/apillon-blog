### Apillon’s coming to sub0 2023


#### Apillon’s CTO Tadej Vengust to give a talk and showcase a live demo at the Polkadot Developer Conference in Lisbon.


This will be the second time Apillon attends sub0, the Polkadot Developer Conference. Once again, you’ll find us networking, exchanging knowledge, and presenting the Web3 building tool that is the Apillon platform to developers. We hope our second time at this two-day gathering is as fruitful as our first.

Besides meeting with the brightest and most impressive Web3 developers and other ecosystem figures, we’re especially excited for the talk by our CTO Tadej Vengust and the Apillon’s Showcase Station, where we’ll be able to demonstrate firsthand what you can build with the Apillon platform. And, what is beyond precious to us — get your thoughts and feedback.

### Unboxing Schrödinger’s NFT: The next evolution of secure file sharing


If you want to discover how to encrypt private files with a designated NFT key, stop by Starter Space A on Tuesday, September 19, at 5.20 PM.


In his talk, Apillon’s CTO Tadej Vengust will focus on Schrödinger’s NFT — a new prototype by Apillon that brings together the power of Phala Network, Moonbeam Network, Crust Network, and Astar Network.

Schrödinger’s NFT works only for one person — the one that owns the key in their wallet.


The NFT key provides a range of use cases, from sealing sensitive files like contracts and documents to sharing or selling raw recordings or manuscripts of digital music and artwork as well as other highly confidential matters.


### Showcase Station


Apillon will set up a Showcase Station that will be accessible both in-person and online.


Drop by the Demo Station area on September 19 and meet the team, enjoy a live Demo of the Apillon platform, share your building experience, and talk anything Web3 with us.


And yes, there will be all kinds of Apillon’s famous merch for you. :wink:
