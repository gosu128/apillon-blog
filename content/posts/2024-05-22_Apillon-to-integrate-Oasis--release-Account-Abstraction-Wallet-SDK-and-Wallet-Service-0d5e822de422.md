### Apillon to integrate Oasis, release Account Abstraction Wallet SDK and WalletÂ Service


#### With the upcoming platform upgrade, Apillon will give developers the means to onboard new audiences through embedded decentralized wallet.

[The problem: User onboarding friction](#4e1c)

[Why Oasis](#63e1)

Aligned with its development strategies, Apillon is in the process of adding another essential upgrade to the platform.


This time, with the Wallet-as-a-Service feature, an abstracted approach to user account management.


### The problem: User onboarding friction


The problem is as old as Web3. Yes, mountains have been moved in terms of technological development. However, the basic mechanisms of how end users interact with Web3 still generate too much friction.


Decentralized and abstracted account management is a big issue for developers, too. If they want to onboard as many users to their decentralized platforms, particularly newbies, they face certain coding challenges ranging from back end to user interface.


Integrating Web3-native elements, such as wallets, is one thing. But itâ€™s quite another to convert a target audience that does not understand the first thing about them.


So, how to bridge the two worlds?


One answer lies in hybrid solutions that would enable frictionless sign-up and sign-in where users interact with the dapp, and, at the same time, handle mnemonics or private keys automatically, in a fully decentralized and private way inside smart contracts, without the need for user intervention.


And this is what Apillon aims to achieve through Oasis Network.


### Apillonâ€™s integration ofÂ Oasis


Oasis is a Layer 1 blockchain network with a strong focus on privacy, scalability, and versatility.

By integrating Oasis into the platform stack, Apillon will initially compile smart contracts that enable non-custodial private key management and an open-source Oasis Account Abstraction Wallet SDK in Vanilla.JS, React.JS, and Vue.JS that support transactions compatible with Ethers.JS and Viem.


Stemming from that SDK, the Apillon platform will further launch a decentralized non-custodial Wallet Service (or Wallet-as-a-Service), allowing developers to integrate the wallet feature into their dapps with a few clicks.


Such a wallet will be easily embedded into a dapp to provide back-end authentication of usernames, passkeys, and passwords. In this sense, it would spare users the need to create or interact with typical Web3 wallets, such as MetaMask, or to act as a custodian of their private keys.


Basically, an embedded wallet would create an onboarding experience similar to what users are familiar with in Web2 environments. At the back end, however, all blockchain-based actions, including payments, would be handled automatically without user interaction.


### Why Oasis


To sustain the Web3 Wallet Service, Apillon opted for Oasis Network, a privacy-first network that allows products built on top to scale without friction.


Its confidential ParaTime layer supports confidential smart contracts, where nodes run in a trusted execution environment (TEE). Encrypted data is decrypted and processed by smart contract, and encrypted before it is sent out of the TEE. This helps data remain confidential and never leaked to the node operator or dapp developer.

Unlike other Layer 1 networks that could potentially risk data leakage, the confidentiality of Oasis unlocks opportunities for developers to build dapps that require the input of personal or sensitive data, usernames and passwords included.


In terms of efficiency, Oasis Networkâ€™s architecture ensures impressive scalability, accelerated transactions, and higher throughput compared to other networks. This is possible due to the networkâ€™s split between consensus and execution (ParaTime) layers.


The versatility of the ParaTime layer further translates into increased agility and customization, designed to address and satisfy the needs of individual applications and use cases. This is achieved through different types of ParaTimes committees, node hardware, and Runtime VMs. Its permissioned or permissionless execution also gives more options for enterprise application and developer experimentation.

### Solution: Web3 Non-Custodial Embedded Wallet SDK andÂ Service


Apillonâ€™s integration of Oasis Network targets developers who want to launch dapps that require user registration but donâ€™t want to stress their community with unfamiliar concepts and unnecessary onboarding steps.


As mentioned above, the integration will produce a two-fold result:


Developers will be able to integrate the Web3 Wallet feature seamlessly into their dapp using SDK while allowing their audiences to utilize Web3 dapps through decentralized and low-friction account registration.


The solution would positively impact Oasis Network and its adoption, too.


The fully open-source, EVM-compatible, and Oasis-branded SDK would incentivize broad public use. Besides, the integration of the Wallet Service into Apillonâ€™s portfolio would expand the networkâ€™s reach to thousands of developers from other ecosystems, generating new activity and transactions.


#### Step 1â€Šâ€”â€ŠIntegrating Web3 Authentication Service


Apillon users will gain access to the Oasis Network capabilities for creating and integrating embedded wallets into their dapps in the upcoming Web3 Wallet Service.


In the set-up process, they could choose between multiple EVM options and multiple Substrate parachains.


The integration would be completed by using API keys generated by the Apillon dashboard and implemented through SDK.


#### Step 2 â€”User onboarding


After successfully integrating the Web3 Wallet service into their dapp, developers could easily onboard new users.


Users will be able to connect a pass key to encrypt their account, while the SDK would automatically generate a new EVM account request on the Oasis Network. There, an Oasis smart contract would generate and encrypt a new private key.


This would allow users to interact with a dapp using only their pass key identifiers, while the Oasis protocol would securely store their unique Web3 credentials.


Ultimately, Apillonâ€™s solution will help developers launch their dapps faster as they would be spared the need of any direct blockchain interaction.


On the other hand, users will be able to enjoy Web3 dapps without having to worry about managing credentials or back-end actions.


### Less friction, betterÂ adoption


With this solution, Apillon will once again bring Web3 closer to the massesâ€Šâ€”â€Šthis time by accelerating Web3 projectsâ€™ go-to-market trajectory and enhancing user experience at the onboarding stage.


The integration of Oasis is about to roll out in the following weeks, so stay tuned and get your coding gear ready.
