The NCTR Airdrop opened its gates in late February 2024. While a good turnaround was somewhat expected, the tens of thousands of participants who flocked in in just a couple of weeks knocked us off our feet.


The numbers are beyond impressive, but even more so, the fact that most of the participants ticked off multiple tasks, manifesting in tangible Web3 results integrating Apillon-supplied solutions, underlying parachains, and Polkadot technologies.


Now that the task period has ended, it’s time for NCTR to make its way to its rightful owners.


Read on to learn what steps you should make and when to expect the juicy NCTR to land in your wallet.


### NCTR launch and distribution roadmap


First, let’s take a look at the timeline of events linked to the launch of NCTR, its distribution, and ultimately, Airdrop.

### How to claim your hard-earned NCTR rewards?


To collect the bonus NCTR tokens you earned through a series of tasks, follow the steps below.


#### Step 1 — Log in and connect wallet


Log in to the Apillon dashboard. On the home page, under Project overview, click “NCTR Airdrop dashboard”.


On the right-hand side, you will see your status in the Airdrop process.


To claim NCTR, you should first connect your EVM-compatible wallet. Scroll down and click “Connect EVM wallet”. Choose a wallet and approve connectivity in its pop-up window.


#### Step 2 — Submit tasks for review (new and mandatory)!


Due to the incredible interest and tens of thousands of users performing dozens of tasks, Apillon has decided to add the task review step into the claim process.


True to its name, this mandatory step requires you to submit the tasks you performed for review. This way, the Apillon team can assess the eligibility and quality of referrals before approving any NCTR claim and ensure fair distribution to every participant.


So, to submit your tasks for review, scroll further down, find the Submit tasks for review window, and click “Submit”.


And you’re done! Once your tasks are reviewed and approved, you can claim NCTR rewards.


#### A few things to keep in mind


In order to execute the NCTR Airdrop as smoothly and fairly as possible to the Apillon community, here are a few rules and terms to be aware of before you commence claiming the NCTR rewards.


👉 You will be able to claim NCTR tokens on the NCTR Airdrop dashboard.


👉 NCTR will be launched on the Moonbeam Network, so get some GLMR tokens to cover the claim transaction.


👉 The submit-to-review window will be open until June 25, 2024. If you fail to submit the tasks to review before that date, you will only be eligible to claim 10 NCTR for account registration and not for the tasks performed. Submitting tasks to review after June 25, 2024, will not be possible.


👉 After June 25, accounts that submitted tasks into review and passed it successfully will become eligible to receive NCTR rewards.


👉 The Airdrop claiming process will start after the NCTR TGE and the token distribution to early contributors. The window to claim earned NCTR will remain open until the end of September, 2024. After that date, you will not be able to claim the airdropped NCTR.

👉 Wallet changes are not possible. If you lost the key to the wallet submitted in the process, you will not be able to claim the tokens.


👉 If you believe a mistake was made during the claim process, you may submit a request for a revision in the #AirdropClaims channel on Apillon Discord. Please note: Any account that requests a revision but is found to be either botting or executing any foul play during the Airdrop will have its NCTR slashed and be labeled as ineligible in upcoming NCTR incentivization events. The task review decision by Apillon is final.

### Look up — More airdrops coming soon!


Apillon has reserved nearly a third of the NCTR tokens supply to incentivize Web3 adoption. Hence, the platform’s future growth activities will highly depend on the NCTR token and its distribution to developers, marketers and other promoters of decentralized solutions.


In this context, Apillon plans to add new tasks to the expanded Airdrop dashboard soon, allowing users to earn greater NCTR rewards for production-ready projects.


Likewise, new opportunities to earn NCTR will manifest through NCTR-based governance, rewarding users for their active participation in governance processes.


More details on NCTR distribution are about to be released so keep your eyes peeled for a new chance to gain rewards.


But first, get ready to collect what you already earned!
