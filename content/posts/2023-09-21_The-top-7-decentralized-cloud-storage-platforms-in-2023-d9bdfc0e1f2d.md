### The top 7 decentralized cloud storage platforms inÂ 2023


#### Decentralized cloud storage is forever changing how we handle digital data. Hereâ€™s a comparison of the best decentralized and blockchain cloud storage providers.


You know what they sayâ€Šâ€”â€Šin the digital age, data is the new gold. If it was oil that was dubbed black gold in the late 19th century, it was now data that was described as the worldâ€™s newest most precious resource back in 2017 by the Economist.

[the Economist](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2017/05/06/the-worlds-most-valuable-resource-is-no-longer-oil-but-data)

Precious resources should be stored in the most secure and efficient way possible. For more than a decade, the go-to choice for web users and enterprises has been centralized cloud storage providersâ€Šâ€”â€Šthink AWS S3, Dropbox, Google Drive, and Apple iCloud. But these robust storage options arenâ€™t without their pain points.


In recent years, new efficient and cost-effective solutions have been emerging to address the weaknesses of traditional storage providers. Decentralized cloud storage providers offer a distributed, faster, more secure, and often times cheaper alternative to centralized cloud storage options.


But how do you know which one best suits your needs?


### Why do we even need decentralized cloudÂ storage?


Thereâ€™s no arguing that centralized cloud solutions like AWS S3 come with their own set of advantages: ease of use, convenience, and scalability are all important criteria to consider when choosing a cloud storage provider.


While centralized clouds might have been the best option in the past, certain pain points and risks were revealed with the onset of data leak scandals and other exploitations.


But where are the weak points that expose centralized clouds to these incidents?


Centralized cloud storage means that all data is stored on a single off-site server or just a handful of servers. In the case of AWS S3, data is stored in Amazonâ€™s proprietary siloes.


Exposed to a single point of failure, centralized servers are prone to censorship, hacking attacks, data leaks, and other security and privacy risks.


Furthermore, centralized cloud storage providers usually come with a high cost of storage and slow data transmission speed.


#### The benefits of decentralized cloudÂ storage


Decentralized cloud storage addresses these pain points by implementing a a decentralized, peer-to-peer network of servers (often called nodes) rather than relying on a single server.


A decentralized data storage system offers you the following advantages:


When data is distributed across a decentralized network, it becomes permanently accessible. If one node in the network goes down, data is still stored on all the others.


With the use of encryption and hashing technology, data is fragmented and distributed across multiple nodes, which makes it impossible for an unauthorized centralized authority to access it or tamper with it.


With no centralized server storing all data in one place, the chances of censorship occurring in a decentralized cloud storage system are pretty much zero.


Aligning with the Web3 principles of data ownership and privacy, users have control over their data. They can decide how their data is stored, who has access to it, and under what conditions it can be shared.


While it depends on the provider, decentralized cloud storage is often more cost-effective than traditional options. Users can even earn rewards or tokens by sharing their excess storage space, lowering their storage costs.


If cryptographic hashing is used, users can verify that their data has not been tampered with or corrupted, ensuring data integrity.


### A comparison of the 7 top decentralized and blockchain cloud storage providers


Here is a comparison of the top 7 decentralized cloud storage companies in 2023. Itâ€™s up to you to decide which one is the best for your needs.


#### Filecoin


Filecoin is a decentralized cloud storage platform that leverages blockchain technology to offer secure and reliable storage solutions.

[Filecoin](https://filecoin.io/)

Filecoin leverages a unique proof-of-storage consensus mechanism to ensure data integrity and security, making stored data resistant to manipulation. The nodes in the Filecoin network can even compete to provide storage space, creating a marketplace for storage services.


With its commitment to decentralization, security, and data protection, Filecoin has gained recognition as a leading player in the decentralized storage ecosystem.


Itâ€™s also one of the cheapest decentralized cloud storage providers out there, offering 1TB at as low as $0.19 per month. Itâ€™s important to note that the price can fluctuate due to market conditions.


#### Arweave


At Arweave, they want you to imagine their blockchain cloud storage services like Bitcoin, but for data: Arweave is a permanent and decentralized web inside an open ledger.

[Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/)

A blockchain-based decentralized storage platform known for its permanent storage capabilities, Arweave uses a unique blockchain architecture as well as its own ecosystem and technology stack to ensure that data stored on its network is immutable and cannot be deleted or modified.


Arweave offers 1TB of storage from $2.19 per month.


#### Sia


What sets Sia apart is its innovative smart contract system, which ensures that users are charged only for the storage they actively use, promoting cost efficiency.

Siaâ€™s reputation system is another noteworthy feature, motivating nodes to maintain high levels of uptime and reliability, further bolstering data accessibility. Furthermore, Sia benefits from an engaged and active community of developers and contributors who are dedicated to continually updating and enhancing the platform.


Sia offers 1TB of storage from $2 per month.


#### Storj


Similarly to Sia, Storj is a decentralized cloud storage provider thatâ€™s known for its innovative smart contract framework, which guarantees that users are charged exclusively for the storage and bandwidth they actively use. Storj also promotes security through its bug bounty program, actively encouraging security researchers to uncover and report any potential vulnerabilities.

[Storj](https://www.storj.io/)

Founded in 2014, Storj has solidified its reputation as a secure and dependable option and managed to forge partnerships with prominent names, including Microsoft and Seagate.


Storj offers 1TB of storage from $4 per month.


#### BitTorrent FileÂ System


Weâ€™ve all heard of BitTorrent but not everybody knows they actually offer a wide range of services, BitTorrent File System.

[BitTorrent File System](https://www.btfs.io/)

BTFS is a scalable decentralized storage system designed to lower storage expenses, enhance fault tolerance, and eliminate censorship. As BTFS already boasts a substantial user node base exceeding 100 million users, itâ€™s a powerful player in the decentralized storage arena. This innovative storage protocol operates on the TRON blockchain.


BTFS offers 1TB of storage from $2.24 per month.


#### IPFS


While it doesnâ€™t leverage blockchain technology, the InterPlanetary File System is a decentralized protocol thatâ€™s used to store and share files in a decentralized system. IPFS leverages a unique approach where files are stored across a network of nodes with a content-addressable system. This means that files are addressed by their content rather than location.

A decentralized alternative to HTTP, IPFS uses end-to-end encryption to protect user data.


As IPFS is not a decentralized cloud storage provider but a decentralized protocol, the prices vary depending on different providers that offer IPFS file storage and file sharing services.


#### Apillon


Leveraging the power of Polkadot parachains, Apillon is a one-stop shop development platform that offers various Web3 services, including decentralized storage, for builders of Web3 projects and dapps.

[Apillon](https://apillon.io/)

Apillonâ€™s blockchain cloud storage uses IPFS and Crust Network, a parachain of the Polkadot blockchain. By combining both the IPFS protocol and blockchain technology, Apillon provides very efficient and secure decentralized cloud storage for developers as well as enterprises.
