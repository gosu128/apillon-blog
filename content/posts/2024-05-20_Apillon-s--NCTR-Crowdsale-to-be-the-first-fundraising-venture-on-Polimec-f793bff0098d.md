To initiate the funding process, Apillon must first pass the 28-day Evaluation period. During this period, the Evaluators review all pertinent project documentation and perform thorough due diligence on the project. The evaluators then offer their backing, which is crucial for proceeding to the funding round.


Want to join the community of Polimec Evaluators? All you need is your KYC by Deloitte and transferable PLMC tokens. We will keep you posted with all the information and tutorials you need.
