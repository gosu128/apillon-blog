### Where can Base take you?


#### Apillon offers you an instant connection to millions of users in an eye blink. But do you know how to get there?


### Base-supported services, real-world impact


On the Apillon platform, choosing the Base chain will be a game-changer for two key services: NFTs and smart contracts, which can be incorporated into many diverse projects. Here are a few ideas:


Scalable dapps without breaking a sweatGot a vision for a DeFi app that handles thousands of daily transactions? Or a rewards platform that keeps users hooked? With Base, scalability isn’t just a feature — it’s baked into the design. You can build high-performance dapps that deliver the experience your users expect without worrying about congestion or costs.


Affordable NFT trading that users actually loveNFTs and high gas fees don’t mix — and Base knows that. Whether it’s launching an NFT marketplace or a project that turns concert tickets into tradeable digital assets, Base cuts the costs so your users can mint, trade, and transfer effortlessly. Platforms like OpenSea are just a starting point — Base gives builders the tools to create marketplaces where the art (or utility) shines, not the fees.


Bridging chains, connecting ideasBase doesn’t lock your dapp into a single chain. It’s built to interact with Ethereum and beyond, letting you bridge assets across chains like Avalanche, Polygon, or others. Imagine creating a dapp where users can seamlessly move tokens between networks or a platform where NFTs minted on Base can appear across other ecosystems. With Base, cross-chain magic comes standard.


Innovations that reshape Web3Builders on Base can get creative — think tokenized memberships for exclusive content, decentralized social media platforms, or gaming economies where in-game items are real, tradeable NFTs. Whether you’re working on the next big DAO or a platform that lets users tokenize their passions, Base keeps your costs and performance low, so you can focus on what matters: creating something incredible.
