### Highlights of Apillon and the Polkadot ecosystem‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäQ2¬†2023


#### Apillon‚Äôs new integrations, UX improvements, and the common good Proposal nicely complemented the Polkadot space expansion and charting of new¬†heights.

[1 Apillon](#9df3)
[2 Polkadot ecosystem](#b215)

Halfway through the year, it‚Äôs time for the second quarterly retrospective of scroll-stopping news at Apillon and in the Polkadot ecosystem.


### 1 Apillon


Following the release of Closed Beta in Q1 and the first concrete layout of the direction the Apillon dashboard and its offering would go, a heavy focus was placed on bringing in more integrations, distilling them to Web3 services, and turning the platform‚Äôs UX up a notch.

[Closed Beta](https://github.com/orgs/Apillon-web3/projects/1)

The work of Apillon developers didn‚Äôt go unnoticed in the Polkadot community, thanks also to the team‚Äôs engagement in Web3 events and consistent outreach.

[1.2 Adoption](#247a)
[1.3 Features & functionalities](#02ea)
[1.4 Events](#5766)
[1.5 Community](#49ab)

Let‚Äôs start with how the product has evolved to this day.


#### 1.1 Platform integrations & Web3¬†Services


The modular approach to creating interoperable and multi-chain dapps with Apillon expanded to few more dimensions.


üîó Following the initial integration of Crust Network to provide Web3 Storage and Hosting services, the Apillon platform integrated Moonbeam Network to provide developers with smart contract service and Astar Network to deliver multi-chain smart contract connectivity.

[Moonbeam Network](https://blog.apillon.io/apillon-integrates-moonbeam-and-brings-the-third-fully-fledged-service-to-the-apillon-web3-adff526633d7)
[Astar Network](https://blog.apillon.io/apillon-partners-with-astar-to-deliver-multi-chain-smart-contract-connectivity-63d1d5f1e288)

üîó The capabilities of Moonbeam and Astar smart contracts came to life in the newest fully-fledged service, the NFT module on the Apillon dashboard. The few-click-deploy NFT service lets anyone launch an end-to-end decentralized NFT collection in minutes.

[few-click-deploy NFT service](https://blog.apillon.io/make-your-own-nft-collection-in-minutes-brought-to-moonbeam-by-apillon-538fdf34fc5)

üîó Apillon also partnered with KILT Protocol to integrate a decentralized authentication service. The integration would allow users to offer wallet-based authentication in their dapps and equip digital assets with DIDs.

[KILT Protocol](https://blog.apillon.io/apillon-to-integrate-decentralized-authentication-from-kilt-protocol-8990fcdeed6d)

üîó And, with the first use case using Phala‚Äôs computing logic together with Crust‚Äôs Web3 Storage and Moonbeam‚Äôs NFT smart contracts, Apillon developed the three-parachain Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs NFT, an end-to-end decentralized decryption key to unlock private files.

#### 1.2 Adoption


The user flow of the first few months was seriously encouraging, but a steadier pace was to be expected once the developer crowd got a sense of the product and its role in their work.


Compared to Q1, the Apillon dashboard raked in 49% more users, while the frequency of new users rolling in took a steadier pace, at nearly 2 users per day, compared to more than 5 in Q1.


üìä Total users on the platform: 756üìä New users per day on average: 1.9


That being said, what paints a clearer picture is what these users actually do with it. Having large crowds registered is pointless if they remain idle.


But they didn‚Äôt.


With 22.761 server requests, user engagement grew stronger in Q2. It demonstrated the utility of the offered Web3 Services range in developers‚Äô work, topped with the possibility of being combined and merged in multi-chain Web3 projects.


Compared to Q1 (15.576 server requests), the Apillon platform users thus generated 46% more requests, with the tallest spike occurring right after the launch of the NFT Service in mid-May.


#### 1.3 Features & functionalities


The Apillon platform was designed to deliver decentralized services to developers in a seamless, easy-on-the-eye, and clickable way, while retaining full flexibility and customization.


But to onboard users and projects to Web3, more options are needed.


üîë Discord connectivity lets users link their Apillon account to Apillon‚Äôs Discord server so they can actively participate in future platform upgrades through community-first governance.

[Discord connectivity](https://blog.apillon.io/apillon-feature-discord-connectivity-960ba1b064ed)

üîë Web3Approved, a joint initiative of Apillon and Crust Network, offers free decentralized hosting for 100 years. At absolutely zero cost, projects can utilize IPFS hosting services via Crust‚Äôs decentralized infrastructure and take the first step to the Web3 space in minutes.

üí™ And, as a nod to the team‚Äôs past work and future plans, Apillon got accepted into the Substrate Builders Program (SBP) by Parity Technologies. With Milestones 1 and 2 in the books, the development team is off to reach new landmarks. The Apillon platform was further reviewed with security confirmed in successfully passed pentest.

#### 1.4 Events


Apillon‚Äôs streak of live appearances continued in Q2 when it navigated stages, booths, and after-hours venues from Ljubljana, Slovenia, to Copenhagen, Denmark.


üìç The fourth edition of Polkadot Meetup Ljubljana brought together top legal experts to discuss the current stage and future prospects of crypto regulation, particularly in the EU, and explore different legal angles of Web3.

#### 1.5 Community


In what is perhaps the most radical upgrade of the project, Apillon has added the plan to become an open-source platform to its roadmap.


üìú With Polkadot Bounty Proposal, Apillon seeks to foster Web3 adoption as a common good infrastructure solution on Polkadot. By delivering Web3 development modules as a common-good, fully accessible solution, the stronger onboarding of developers would exponentially spearhead the adoption of Web3 technologies, particularly of Polkadot.

[2.5 Phala Network](#a6a8)
[2.6 Astar Network](#0bda)

#### 2.1 Polkadot


The Polkadot Network kept a strong pace in developer activity and active accounts. Every day, thousands of new accounts joined in, contributing to consistent space growth.


The v3 version of Cross-Consensus Message Format (XCM) was launched and delivered advanced features, including the ability to connect to external networks, multi-hop setup, cross-chain NFTs, etc. The on-chain XCM activity further proved the need for stronger interoperability across the Polkadot space.

In other news:


üëâ OpenGov was released on Polkadot in mid-June to optimize the on-chain governance, bring more power to the community, and increase decentralized voting efficiency. By dissolving the Council collective and the Technical Committee, the OpenGov‚Äôs referendum mechanism allows for more flexibility and democracy in the voting process, including the decision-making on Treasury funds spending, while retaining the previously high security.

[OpenGov](https://polkadot.network/newsroom/press-releases/polkadot-hands-decision-making-powers-to-its-community-with-opengov-launch)

üëâ The renewed vision of Polkadot as a space and technology provider was laid out by Dr Gavin Wood at Polkadot Decoded 2023. As a ubiquitous, multi-core supercomputer, Polkadot would surpass the relaychain-parachain architecture with more elaborated, flexible, and cost-effective blockspace. With a focus on building application-centric middleware, Polkadot would provide agile and different ways of connecting to the network, serving a range of projects with different Web3 needs. New functionality would be further introduced by ‚Äòaccords‚Äô, a type of opt-in agreements with several multi-chain use cases, ultimately delivering a more secure and seamless user experience than bridges and other third-party gateways.

üëâ KILT‚Äôs Decentralized Identity Provider (DIP) enables the creation of open identity infrastructure, allowing parachain projects to delegate identity management to other parachains that supply identity solutions. Thanks to XCM, DIPs can be easily integrated into systems that extend beyond the Polkadot space. With KILT‚Äôs DIP, decentralized identity reaches the real world and gives control of identity back to the person it belongs to. Read more

#### 2.4 Moonbeam¬†Network


üëâ Moonbeam‚Äôs Routed Liquidity (MRL) allows for the easy flow of crypto liquidity into and across the Polkadot ecosystem from other ecosystems. And, thanks to the implementation of XC-20s, any ERC-20 created in the Moonbeam EVM becomes movable around the Polkadot ecosystem via XCM. MRL can thus route liquidity from external chains to any Polkadot parachain. Read more
