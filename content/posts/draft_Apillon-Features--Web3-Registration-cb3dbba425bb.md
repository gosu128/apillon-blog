perks:


reasons:


web3 authentication is perfectly compatible with traditional login methods. the mapping should be done between each acccountâ€™s public address and the web3 authentication authorization flow.


however, this authorization flow may not be a good choice for everyone. because to perform the web3 authentication:


manually logging in involves dealing with public-private key pairs, which could be difficult to use for newbies. fortunately, many trusted hot crypto wallets are available in browser extensions or mobile apps. these wallets can be used to store and manage cryptocurrencies.


### What are Web3Â wallets?


web3 wallets have introduced innovative ways to manage and monetize content, assets, and identities. web3 wallets allow users to use hardware or software to access cash but alsot o conenct to decentralized apps, collect NFTs and build products on-chain. they are far more flexible than traditional wallets. although wallets donâ€™t hold cryptocurrency, they have the information to access digital currency.


a cryptocurrency wallet is made up of three components:


there are many types of wallets available in the web3 domain. each one with advantages and functionalities depending on how user manage their finances and data.


### Authentication and authorization in web3 using aÂ wallet


Web3 wallets can be used to authenticate web3 transactions. some of the most trusted solutions are MetaMask, WalletConnect, Web3Auth, and Formatic. each option offers a great user experience. The first three are perfect for native crypto users, the latter two are more accessible to all users.


weâ€™ll go with MetaMask for this example. MM is a browser extension that acts as an app and crypto wallet. It is a gateway to the blockchain. Can be downloaded as a browser extension or desktop app and installed. it allows users to manage private key that controls the Ethereum address and facilitates transactions with blockchain apps. it is based originally on the ethereum network and ethereum is the default network. it allows for easy adding of the EVM-compatible networks. loggin in using MM is quick and convenient, so it is the preferred choice for authentication in web3. MM makes it much easier ot create dapps.


web3 wallet authentication strengthens appâ€™s security by eliminating risky password management practices and reduces the overhead of managing the passwords in database. when we connect to the wallet, we get a public key/public address/wallet address thta can be used to map and manage our assets and data.


### Web3 login the ApillonÂ way


#### Register toÂ Apillon


Apillon is redefining the way developers think of Web3. Registration included.


Contrary to complex practices of signing up to Web3-based products and apps, which include generation of seed phrases and employment of decentralized authentication tools, Apillon makes Web3 more approachable.


You will be able to register to the Apillon platform using simply your email address and a password. This is quite a revolutionary way of approaching Web3 technologies, as it bypasses the complexity of setting up a wallet and navigating self-custodial means of authentication.


These are all handled in the back-end, with the Apillon platform serving as a bridge between traditional user login methods and Web3 technologies.


Upon registration, you will receive an email containing a link. Clicking on it will activate your account and open the door to the Apillon dashboard.
