Apillon just released w3ndi, an app that lets you link your self-sovereign digital identity by KILT with your digital wallet addresses under one roof — or, rather, your web3name.

Here is how to do it step by step.


### Step 1: Create a DID and a w3n


First things first, you need a digital identity by KILT Protocol, a DID, and a web3name. Without those things, you can’t use w3ndi nor browse by w3n in Nova Wallet.


web3name is a custom, human-readable name you create to represent your decentralized identifier (DID), a long string of alphanumeric characters.


If you don’t have a digital identity by KILT yet, install the Sporran wallet and set up your DID and w3n.

Once you have your digital identity by KILT in place, start adding your digital wallets and linking them to your w3n.


### Step 2: Add wallets in w3ndi


Go to w3ndi.apillon.io and click the “Enter now” button.

Next, you’re prompted to connect with your Sporran wallet — either directly via your browser extension or by entering your mnemonic phrase. In this guide, we’ll go with wallet extension.


Select the account you’d like to connect and click “Connect Sporran”.


In case your account in not yet linked to your DID, you’ll be prompted to do so. Click “Link account”, authorize linking in your Sporran wallet, and sign the transaction using your Sporran password.


Once you’re in, start adding wallets to your DID and w3n.


Click “Add new wallet”.


In the pop-up window, select the chain of your wallet address. Next, add a tag to differentiate it from others quickly, for example, “Private”, “Business”, “Charity”, “Friends & family”, etc.


Provide the wallet address either manually or by connecting your wallet via a browser extension.


#### 1 Enter address manually


Toggle “Type address”. Type in — or, rather, copy-paste — your wallet address. If you want it to be used on multiple chains, click the checkbox and choose the ones you want to support.


#### 2 Connect wallet directly


You can also provide a wallet address by connecting a wallet via browser extensions. Select the chain your wallet is on, and toggle “Connect wallet”. Here, too, you can choose to use the address on multiple chains. Click “Connect wallet” again, and in a new pop-up, select the chosen wallet and confirm linking in the wallet extension window.


Lastly, click “Save” or “Save and add another” to aggregate more addresses to your w3n.


### Step 3: Deploy


Now, you can see an index of wallet addresses you linked to your w3n, together with information about the chain they operate on, tag, and their status — currently undeployed.


To make them active, inscribed on-chain, and pinned on IPFS via Crust, click “Save and deploy”.


As the linkage between your w3n and wallet addresses gets deployed on-chain, w3ndi passes three steps:


To finish the process, authorize it by signing with your Sporran wallet. Click “Sign” and “Sign the transaction” again.


Once done, you will see the status of addresses update to “Deployed”.


That’s it! Your w3n by KILT is now linked to an index of your digital wallet addresses, and you can use it in Nova Wallet to send or receive funds easily.


### Step 4: Use w3n in Nova Wallet


Now, you can transfer digital assets simply by finding the contact’s address via their w3n.


Click “Send”, and choose the asset and network.


In the Recipient field, type in “w3n:[recipient’s w3n]”.


Choose the address you want to send to — the easiest way is to refer to tags, such as “friends and family”, “primary”, etc.


Enter the amount of assets you wish to transfer, and click “Continue”.


As easy as that. The w3ndi feature will save you the time and hassle of copy-pasting lengthy addresses in Nova.
