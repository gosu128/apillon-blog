### Step-by-step: How to pay with $DOT on the Apillon¬†platform


#### Check through the steps to complete your crypto payment to purchase building credits on the Apillon platform.


By introducing $DOT as a cryptocurrency payment option, the Apillon Web3 development platform is entering a new decentralization realm.


Builders should leverage their work time to build awesome Web3 projects and not misspend it on necessary token holding, asset volatility management, and other token-adjacent issues that do not involve voluntary crypto-asset handling.


### Why $DOT?


$DOT is the most promising option for all builders conjuring up Web3 projects in the Polkadot network. Polkadot operates within a broader ecosystem of blockchain platforms and projects, and besides its internal dynamics, its success depends also on how it collaborates with other blockchain ecosystems.


### How to buy building power with¬†$DOT


You‚Äôve onboarded to the Apillon platform and built some fantastic Web3 stuff‚Ä¶ and now you need more platform credits to keep building. Way to go!


First, log into your Apillon account. Once on the Apillon dashboard, click on the arrow next to your profile avatar in the top right corner and choose ‚ÄúBilling‚Äù in the drop-down menu.

[log into your Apillon account](https://app.apillon.io/login)

This action will take you to the Billing and Usage section of your profile, where you can select the upgrade of your current status. If you intend to buy more credits, click on the yellow button on the left to ‚ÄúGet more.‚Äù


After expressing your intention to buy credits, you can select a package of your choosing. The more credits you purchase, the bigger the bonus of free extra credits.


Let‚Äôs say you purchase 20K credits and wish to pay for them with $DOT tokens. Click on the yellow button ‚ÄúBuy with DOT,‚Äù and you‚Äôll be redirected to the NOWPayments landing page, dedicated for you to finish the financial transaction that looks like thisüëá


When you reach the payment process screen, be on the lookout for three important things (in blue frames on the upper screengrab, going from the top right corner down):


‚òùÔ∏è Important: The amount of $DOTs you pay must be identical to the one listed on the screen. It is best to use a ‚Äúcopy‚Äù symbol on the right side to paste it as is when entering the amount into your wallet or whatever means you will use to settle the account.


Then, it‚Äôs time to decide how to pay with $DOT. You can use your hot wallet, a cold wallet, your favorite crypto exchange‚Ä¶ anything that holds your $DOTs. In our case, we‚Äôll demo the Talisman wallet browser extension and simulate paying with $DOT.


After choosing your desired account in the wallet to pay from, you copy and paste the address as described above and double-check that both instances are precisely the same: the address on the left side (white background) and the ‚Äúto‚Äù field when sending funds on the right side (black background). Confirm the transaction.


You will have to wait a few moments for a final confirmation.


Congrats, you have successfully paid for credits on the Apillon Web3 development platform ü§ù


Now build away! If there‚Äôs anything we can help you with, contact Apillon support on Discord and we‚Äôll be happy to help.
