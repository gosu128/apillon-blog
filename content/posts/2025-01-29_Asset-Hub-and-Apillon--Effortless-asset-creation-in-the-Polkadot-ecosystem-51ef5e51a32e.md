### Apillon: your no-code gateway to Asset Hub


Creating assets on Asset Hub used to be a complex process — navigating Substrate’s asset pallet, dealing with governance rules, and manually executing transactions through the Polkadot.js UI. Not exactly beginner-friendly.


With a simple UI, Apillon removes the complexity and lets you create and manage assets effortlessly — no coding required.


Whether you’re launching a community token, an NFT series, or a fully-fledged asset-backed project, Apillon’s integration with Asset Hub makes asset creation easier than ever.


### How to deploy and manage assets with Apillon


Ready to launch your own token? Here’s how Apillon simplifies the process:

### Your very own guide to asset creation


Let’s start with some visual representation so it will be easier to follow.


After the 4 steps mentioned above you followed, you should now land here 👇


Before creating your asset, take a moment to explore existing ones on Asset Hub. It’s a quick way to spark new ideas or double-check if your desired ticker and ID are still available — so you don’t run into surprises later.


Once you’re ready to move forward, click “Create new asset” to kick off the setup process. Next, we’ll fine-tune the details to get your asset just right.


Next, to create your asset, fill out the form with all the required details — this ensures it’s fully functional and ready to go. If you’re unsure about any field, use the helper tooltips or the explanations on the right side of the form.


#### Key fields to fill out:


Choose between testnet (Westend) for testing or mainnet for live deployment. We recommend testing on Westend first to avoid unnecessary clutter on Mainnet.


2. Characteristics:


3. Issuer address & Freezer address:


These should match the wallet you connected in the first step. This ensures that your wallet holds control over asset issuance and freezing functions. Double-check these addresses before proceeding to avoid access issues later!

Once signed and confirmed, your asset is officially live on the blockchain! You can view the transaction details in the link.


🚀 And that’s it! Your asset is now live on Asset Hub and ready for use.


After closing the pop-up, you’ll be redirected to the main asset list. Above it, you’ll see a dedicated section for your newly created assets.


Clicking on it will open its details, where you’ll find all available actions on the right side. And just like that, your asset is now live and ready to be managed.


### Managing your asset post-creation


Once your asset is live, Apillon provides an intuitive interface for tracking, transferring, and modifying your tokens. Some key management features include:


### Why choose Apillon for asset creation?
