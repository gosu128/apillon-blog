### Apillon launches an invitation-only Closed Beta of the Web3 development platform


#### Apillon is excited to offer the first test and a chance for a practical walk-through of a simplified Web3 building toolkit, a one-stop shop that is its Web3 development platform.


By lowering the entry barrier to Web3, Apillon is offering more and more support to the world that’s transitioning from Web2 and taking a leap into the decentralized landscape. The time has come to reap the benefits of the hard work we’ve been putting in for the past few months. Register on the Apillon platform and get invited to test the Closed Beta waters yourself!


#### Closed Beta — Open invitation


The Apillon platform will deliver Web3 functionalities provided by Polkadot parachains through clear-cut API key access and documentation. Thanks to interoperability as one of the main Polkadot advantages, Apillon users will soon be able to combine and integrate different use cases into their Web3 projects.


The APIs on the platform will introduce the developers to a faster and simplified Web3 building, providing them with a more straight road leading from a project’s inception to its launch and enhancing the go-to-market process, which is especially crucial in the make-or-break phase of every project.


For the first time, the Apillon platform will allow you to seamlessly use and implement the most vital services of the decentralized infrastructure. The Closed Beta version of the Apillon platform integrates APIs for accessing services powered by Crust Network, offering two essential aspects of decentralized projects:

#### What will the Closed Beta entail?


At this stage, Apillon is opening the beta-testing to invited groups to use the integrated basic features in a production environment to uncover any potential bugs and issues and to express feedback on any possible upgrades.


The Apillon platform will be unlocked for testing case by case through invitation-only access. At this point, we welcome all the developers who have been our earliest adopters and all other builders patiently awaiting the first features and service integrations on the Apillon platform.


The Closed Beta testing will be assisted and mentored on a need-be basis. Nino Kutnjak, CPO at Apillon, will be available in a dedicated channel on Apillon Discord for any queries, issues and other information you might have. All the gas fees needed for the transactions in the Closed Beta version of the platform will be covered by Apillon.

The main goal of the Closed Beta test is to gather extensive feedback on the current functionalities and possible fine-tuning that could enrich the user experience.

We know we are only getting started. We look forward to keep delivering the building blocks to create a decentralized web and becoming the go-to platform for all the builders eager to build Web3 with us, through us, and around us.


Special thanks to our Polkadot ecosystem partners and collaborators involved in the works of the current and future integrations to the Apillon platform. All the best is yet to come.
