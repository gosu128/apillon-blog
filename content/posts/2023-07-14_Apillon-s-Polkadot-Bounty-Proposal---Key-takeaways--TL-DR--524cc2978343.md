As a preliminary act to the on-chain voting and encouraging community discussion, Apillon submitted an updated Proposal for Polkadot ecosystem funding to Polkassembly.

[Apillon aims to foster Web3 adoption as a common good infrastructure solution on PolkadotTransforming the Web3 development platform into a common-good solution would expedite and ease the Web3 onboarding ofâ€¦blog.apillon.io](https://blog.apillon.io/apillon-aims-to-foster-web3-adoption-as-a-common-good-infrastructure-solution-on-polkadot-6566508190c5)

To help you navigate the Proposalâ€™s scope, intent, and reasoning, here is the condensed version of the 56-page document.


### Recent changes


First, itâ€™s important to note that the current version of the Proposal contains updates to the initial version.


Following the feedback garnered in the past weeks and raised doubts by the community, the changes are as follows:

[Apillon Proposal changing course: From Treasury to BountyThe Polkadot community raised a few legitimate concerns regarding the Proposal; hence some structural changes were madeâ€¦blog.apillon.io](https://blog.apillon.io/apillon-proposal-changing-course-from-treasury-to-bounty-7ff6e2c69800)

Now, the key points of the paper.


### The aim of theÂ Proposal


Every new developer on Apillon is a new developer for Polkadot and Web3.


By becoming an open-source, common-good project, Apillon would catalyze Web3 adoption by delivering widespread access to Web3 services. Apillon Web3 services are few-click and low-code modules that abstract the complexity of Polkadot parachains into their core functionalities. They can be mixed and matched to power multi-chain Web3 products, done and deployed in minutes.


DOT-based open governance would let the Apillon community decide on future platform upgrades, including parachain integrations. This would turn Apillon into a highly user-oriented, agile, and market-relevant project.


Curated Bounty funding would reward the Apillon team for achieved milestones, both predefined and those agreed upon via governance over the dynamic integration backlog. Such a funding scheme is bound to keep the Apillon team motivated and striving for optimal results for the Web3 developer community support.

### The way to achieveÂ goals


#### Ecosystem Fitâ€Šâ€”â€ŠFaster and Cheaper Web3 Development


Positioned above the parachain (L1) and smart contract (L2) layers, Apillon gives developers direct access to underlying infrastructure services.


The deeper-layer technologies are abstracted to ensure easier and more affordable development of Web3 solutions. This allows builders, both of Web2 and Web3, to increase productivity, accelerate their career, and contribute to the general adoption of Polkadot parachains.


#### Parachain integrations & Web3Â Services


Web3 services on the Apillon dashboard are turn-key modules that provide direct access to integrated parachains and their main functionalities.


Few-click and low-code deployment lowers the entry barrier to Web3 and focuses on developer and user experience rather than complex coding.


To date, Apillon has integrated:

#### Payment Module


Addressing one of the major friction points of Web3 adoptionâ€Šâ€”â€Šcrypto asset volatilityâ€Šâ€”â€ŠApillon further implements an advanced, multi-chain payment module.


This allows Apillon-built Web3 projects to scale uninterruptedly without constantly needing to supply volatile asset bags or take FX risk just to power project operations.


Apillonâ€™s payment module can handle a high amount of cross-chain crypto transactions in a secure manner. Transactions can be created in one place and signed elsewhere to maintain the security of private keys. The module also supports the transmission and monitoring of high transactional throughput.


#### Centralized points and decentralized solutions


To achieve full decentralization, three currently centralized areas of Apillon would need to distribute the way theyâ€™re being managed.


Future integrations and service portfolioThe Apillon Community would govern the platformâ€™s scope and evolution, including the dynamic integration backlog, prioritization, and future milestones.


Payments architecture and controlDedicated custody and profit bags overseen by a decentralized committee would supply the constant flow of funds to the Apillon platform.


Development milestone deliveryBounty funds, curated by community-appointed curators, would be disbursed to the Apillon team once the development milestones are met.


#### Apillon future


Price stability moduleIn future versions, the Apillon platform would address the challenge of product price stability with price stability pools.


Price stability pools would be supplied by parachains integrated into the Apillon platform and remain their responsibility. This would remove the risk of users managing several volatile tokens just to power Apillon-built Web3 products.


Future parachain integrationsAnd, to constantly remain market-relevant, Apillon would integrate more parachains and Web3 tools to expand the spectrum of Web3 services accessible to developers. These can be found in the Dynamic Integration Backlog.


Future integrations would be voted on by the community and executed in different timeframes due to varying complexity.


### Ecosystem impact


As Apillon reaches wider developer audiences, it would leave a mark on the Web3 and Polkadot space, thanks to:


### DOT-based product governance


Apillon governance is focused on the Apillon platform, its services, and features. The platform users can co-design its offering, prioritize the integration of parachains, and adopt Web3 technologies faster.


Apillonâ€™s product governance touches upon all product-related decisions, including the goals preset in the Dynamic Integration Backlog as well as UI changes, UX improvements, etc.


A tighter feedback loop between voters and the Apillon team would enhance Apillonâ€™s product-market fit and clear up backlog and development priorities.


### Proposed timeline &Â roadmap


To ensure fast but realistic product evolution, Apillon proposes three Milestones within two years.


#### Milestone 1: Q4Â 2023


#### Subsequent milestones: Q4 2024 to Q3Â 2025


For the following two milestones, integrations are predicted from two instances:


Aligned with the dynamic nature of the Polkadot ecosystem, the deliverables of Milestones 2 and 3 are not predefined but depend on community vote following thorough research and proposal by the Apillon team.


Milestone 2: Q4 2024


Milestone 3: Q3 2025


#### Bounty funding


The Apillon Bounty funding would serve as a reward mechanism upon milestone completion to cover both the runway and regular costs.


Spanning two years from Q3 2023 to Q3 2025, it would back the teamâ€™s effort of delivering Web3 solutions to the broadest developer audience possible.


The child bounty payouts would be managed and approved by a team of community-appointed curators upon reviewing Apillon deliverables.


Itâ€™s also important to note that the community retains the right to cancel the bounty in case the results end up not meeting expectations.


This way, Apillon places full control over its 2-year operations funding in the hands of the ecosystem, and works daily to live up to the promise of Web3â€Šâ€”â€Ša more inclusive, engaged, and flattened community of web builders.


### DOTs put to goodÂ purpose


Lastly, food for thought. The Polkadot Treasury currently holds 46M DOT, and every 24 days, 1% of the unspent funds is burned. What if some of it was put to better use, say, to back the adoption of Web3 via a multi-chain Web3 development platform?

[holds 46M](https://www.dotreasury.com/dot/)
[1%](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-polkadot-opengov-treasury#treasury-inflow-and-outflow)

We can make it happen.


The Apillon Bounty Proposal is now live for voting. Go to Polkassembly and vote AYE for the future of Web3 evolution.
