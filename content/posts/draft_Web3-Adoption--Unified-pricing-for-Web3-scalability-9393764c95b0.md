### Benefits forÂ users


Stable expense sheets, predictable costs, improved funds management, less surprises, more stability, less worrying about volatility, market sentiment, more time for development, better ROI, etc.


The Apillon platform is designed to accept payments in either fiat money, stablecoins, or even volatile assets. As it cannot impact the utility of supported parachainsâ€™ native tokens, the platform sustains a pricing model that resists their volatility and provides users with stable monthly pricing. This way, they can adequately plan the resources spent on Web3 projects.
