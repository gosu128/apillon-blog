#### MENT is introducing NFT-powered visual art initiatives, fan engagement and loyalty programs through Apillon‚Äôs platform and on-site¬†support.

In light of this year‚Äôs decennial, MENT Ljubljana organizers are topping it all off with additional bonuses, offered through their freshly launched NFTs, intended for the music and art enthusiasts, concertgoers, conference attendees, fans, and selected performing artists.


The main purpose is to interconnect both physical and digital realms of art and music and equip them with valuable perks and benefits for the next generations of MENT, or as they put it, for ‚Äúthe shape of MENT to come.‚Äù


### MENT be minting with¬†Apillon


MENT Ljubljana has already pioneered blockchain tech in the previous performances of the festival. And for the celebratory 10th year, there will be quite a few occasions to snatch a value-packed NFT or two.


You might win a surprise bonus for your attendance when MENT comes to town next year. Maybe you‚Äôll get a special privilege to hear the news among the first. Or, you‚Äôll casually decide to buy an inspiring artwork and hang it on your digital wall(et).


Opportunities where you will be able to buy or simply get digitally-based MENT value in the form of an NFT will be the following:


#### 1. appointMENT‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääposter art¬†NFTs


The 8th edition of the appointMENT project will feature unique posters inspired by the festival‚Äôs music acts, showcased in DobraVaga gallery. Created by 74 talented Slovenian and Serbian artists, the diverse sea of art will be presented using the digital printing technique.

Enters Apillon, these remarkable posters will shapeshift into NFTs to provide the artists with tools to enter the Web3 era of business, as they will be able to put their artwork for Web3 sale. Be on the lookout to buy yourself something pretty.


#### 2. MENT-minted tokens of appreciation


As a reward for the general attendance at the 10th MENT, the festival will distribute 200 bonus-providing MENT tokens, bringing unique perks for the 2025 event.


The loyalty perks have not yet been revealed; however, there‚Äôs talk about early-bird ticket offers, other reduced rates, special rewards, hear-it-first newsletter subscriptions and merchandise options.


The 200 NFTs will run in 4 different tiers, each providing a separate set of bonuses. And, as the supply is scarce, we suggest you make a mental note so you don‚Äôt miss your chance.


The mechanics of winning the attendance-driven perks:


If you‚Äôre not fast enough, you‚Äôll be placed on a waitlist‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthen you‚Äôll just have to cross your fingers and hope somebody forgot to claim theirs, so you might still get your turn.


#### Stay tuned!


In any case, keep an eye out for the QR code to secure these fabulous perks. And don‚Äôt worry, we won‚Äôt leave you hanging. If you haven‚Äôt participated in the NFT business yet and don‚Äôt have a digital wallet, you‚Äôll get all the info at the right time.
