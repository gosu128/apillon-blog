The primary purpose is to interconnect and simplify the two main parts of any Web3 project: raising funds for a sustainable future and accessing a more simplified Web3 development toolkit to enter the market more promptly.


### Helping projects lift off-ground


The most essential assets in starting a new venture are the skills to fundraise and the knowledge to use the tools available to find a perfect product-market fit. You can get ahold of both as a product of the joint association of Apillon and Polimec.


Polimec is dedicated to enable Web3 startups raise funds through a decentralized, on-chain process while adhering to regulatory guidelines. Connecting and collaborating with industry players is important to offer value beyond fundraising, supporting the sustainable launch of projects that have raised funds on Polimec.
