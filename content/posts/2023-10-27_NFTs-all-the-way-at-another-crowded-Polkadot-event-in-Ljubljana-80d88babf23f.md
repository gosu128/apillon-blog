### NFTs all the way at another crowded Polkadot event in Ljubljana


#### New setting, a new topic, but just as outstanding an event as the previous ones.


The Polkadot Meetup Ljubljana was once again well-attended. Well, all Polkadot events usually are, to be honest.


This time, it took place in an entirely new environment — the first get-together at what we anticipate will develop into a regional Hub for all things Polkadot and Web3: the recently renovated Apillon HQ.


The focus was on NFTs. We assembled an excellent team of speakers, starting with Miha Artnak, the co-founder & CEO of Ljudje Strategic Design Studio and the co-founder of Bitcoin Studio, and Klemen Peternel, co-founder & CEO of Kalmia, which provides technical consulting and software development services for Web3 builders. They were accompanied by Matjaž Sobočan, CEO and Tadej Vengust, CTO from the Apillon team.

### Who is who of the Slovenian Web3 crowd


Matjaž welcomed the ever-growing Web3 community to our HQ and expressed his belief that this place will become a go-to destination for all Web3 enthusiasts. And what a view of the fully packed house it was!


Miha and Klemen presented a diverse perspective on the NFT landscape. Contrary to common perceptions, non-fungible tokens revealed themselves as more than just aesthetically pleasing creations — from gaming to music, we touched base on different utilities and discussed on what the future will bring for NFTs.


Tadej from the Apillon team presented another interesting utility of NFTs. Schrödinger’s NFT: a new prototype by Apillon for unlocking encrypted files using a non-fungible token as a key.

He explained how the upgraded version of Apillon-built NFTs is a key that lets you open a decentralized storage box and reveal its contents. If the key is wrong, the contents remain locked permanently until you apply the right one. Similar to Schrödinger’s cat, you don’t know what you find inside the box until you open it.
