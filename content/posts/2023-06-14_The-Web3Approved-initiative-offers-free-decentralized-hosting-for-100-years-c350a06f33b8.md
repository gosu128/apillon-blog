If you’re familiar with Apillon’s mission and vision, you know we’re all about making the transition to a Web3 sphere faster, smoother, and cheaper for all participants.


Speaking of boosting the broader adoption of Web3 technologies and decentralizing operations within the Web3 ecosystem, decentralized hosting is an excellent first step to take on this journey.


And since every movement can always use a (free) jumpstart or two, we’ve now joined forces with Crust Network, a decentralized cloud storage provider, to add our block to the Web3 adoption process — by offering free IPFS hosting services for projects and websites.

### Let’s walk the Web3 walk


In light of being a Web3 service provider that promotes, provides, and adopts decentralized features whenever appropriate, Apillon migrated the apillon.io website to Web3-based hosting a while back.

We moved our website from AWS to a decentralized network of hosting servers using the Apillon Web3 Hosting service, powered by IPFS and Crust Network. Living by our values is essential to us, and we wanted to set an example and inspire others to make their websites unstoppable and reap the benefits of decentralized hosting.


Enter the Web3Approved initiative that was inspired by best practice examples from the ecosystem, including Polkadot, Uniswap, and Aave.

### Why join the Web3Approved initiative?


The Web3Approved program provides the first 100 projects that join with free decentralized hosting for their websites for the next 100 years.


Decentralized or Web3-based website hosting means that web files get stored on a decentralized network of nodes instead of a centralized, single point-of-access (or failure) server. This manner of website hosting is associated with a range of benefits compared to central hosting solutions, including:


### How does this set-and-forget technology work?


#### IPFS


In a nutshell, IPFS splits the uploaded files into smaller chunks and creates cryptographic hashes. It also receives a unique fingerprint called a content identifier (CID), which acts as a permanent record of your file as it is at that point in time.


If you want to know more about how IPFS and the Web3 Hosting service on the Apillon platform works, you can read more about it here.:point_down:
