The Apillon platform is a comprehensive tool that helps developers onboard to Web3 in a few-click fashion without diving deep into the back-end codeâ€™s nitty gritty.


But it was not built just for those who want a quick ticket to Web3 (although it gets them there alright). With our peer software developers in mind, weâ€™re also constantly looking for ways to improve their programming experience.


The latest additions to Apillonâ€™s dev toolbox are SDK and CLI. Both currently offer support for the Web3 Storage, Hosting, NFT and IPNS services, and will sustain the Web3 Authentication and upcoming services soon.


### Apillon SDK


First, Apillonâ€™s software development kit (SDK) is a collection of platform-specific building tools for developers available in one installable package, which comprises of libraries and tools for interacting with Apillon-provided services.

With Apillon SDK, youâ€™re spared the need to use Apillonâ€™s REST API. You also donâ€™t have to compose boilerplate code. But you do get multi-step flows packed into a single operation.

Once you install the Apillon SDK as anÂ .npm library, you can use it for your Web3 project or in your script.


The SDK cuts the need for you to call the Apillon API every time you wish to access the Apillon-provided services. Instead, you can modularly integrate the Apillon services in your Web3 project through coding in TypeScript or JavaScript languages.


Get started with Apillon SDK. ðŸ‘‡

#### Apillon SDKÂ example


Apillon SDK consists of different modules depending on which Web3 service you want to use. All modules require the same initial configuration of key and secret.


To illustrate the use of SDK, letâ€™s look at the Storage module, which encloses the functionalities of the Web3 Storage service by Apillon.

### Apillon CLI


The second addition, Apillonâ€™s command line interface (CLI), allows you to interact with the Apillon API simply by inputting commands into a text-based interface.

Install the Apillon CLI. ðŸ‘‡

#### CLI commandÂ example


To illustrate the use of CLI commands, letâ€™s apply them to the context of the NFT service.

In this example, the nfts list-collections command lists all NFT collections owned by a project related to an API key. When paired with --status <3>Â , where integer 3represents deployed collections, the response is the following. ðŸ‘‡


#### Apillon CLI in CI/CDÂ tools


You can also use the Apillon CLI in CI/CD builds and pipelines.


For example, you can leverage it to deploy a website through GitHub Actions. ðŸ‘‡

### Enhancing DevX, one line of code at aÂ time


The release of Apillon SDK and CLI unlocks new opportunities for developers and equips them with readily accessible automation, scripting, and automated website deployment through CLI, just to name a few.


While previously, the only (coding) way to integrate and execute Web3 features into your projects was using API keys and secrets, you can now tap into greater development opportunities by simply utilizing commands, libraries and tools.


With new SDK and CLI options, Apillon hopes to turn the speed and quality of releasing new Web3 projects up a notch and tame developersâ€™ daily stress levels. Because even the shortest line of code can go a long way.
