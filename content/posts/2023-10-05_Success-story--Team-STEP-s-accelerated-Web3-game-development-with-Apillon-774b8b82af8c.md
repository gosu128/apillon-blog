### The biggerÂ picture


Team STEP is an international team that builds games in Unity and Godot, as well as tools, applications, and platforms.

To ensure their games are fully Web3 compatible, Team STEP needed to integrate a fully decentralized infrastructure and make the deployed applications unstoppable.

One of Team STEPâ€™s projects in need of a decentralized infrastructure was Witch One, a stealth, hide-and-seek game set in a medieval fantasy world.

Developing the front end and standard game mechanics was not an issue. What caused more head-scratching and consumed too much of the teamâ€™s time was the technical onboarding to Web3.


### Problem: High threshold toÂ Web3


At Team STEP, several engineers work on each game, however, only the lead developer understands in-depth the intricacies of Web3 infrastructure. Other development team members master legacy methods of Web2 but are not that familiar with Web3 architecture and its specifics. The high threshold to Web3 was slowing down the release trajectory of Team STEP games and, ultimately, their potential for success.


To accelerate the development process and make games hosted decentrally, Team STEP needed a reliable, turn-key tool that would compensate for the deficiency of humanly acquired Web3 expertise.


This is where Apillon stepped inâ€¦


### Solution: Apillonâ€™s Web2-like development methods


Team STEP switched manual code drilling for Apillonâ€™s Decentralized Storage and Hosting services.


New game builds are now automatically deployed to Apillon Decentralized Storage through GitHub Actions, Apillon CLI, and API.


#### Automated decentralized game hosting, STEP-by-step


The transition to the fully Web3 back-end of Team STEP games was straightforward.


#### API, the way toÂ Web3


By utilizing Apillonâ€™s API, Team STEPâ€™s developers set the complete Web3 game infrastructure in a way they are familiar withâ€Šâ€”â€Šusing Web2 gateways, while reaping the benefits of decentralized hosting and file storage.


The code snippet above resumes calling Apillon API in Team STEPâ€™s Witch One game (see more on GitHub).
