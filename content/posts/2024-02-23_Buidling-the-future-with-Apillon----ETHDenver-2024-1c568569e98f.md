### Buidling the future with Apillon — ETHDenver 2024


#### This year marks the third time the Apillon team presents recent updates and hard work at the world’s largest, longest-running Web3 event.


Each year, it’s an honor to join fellow Web3 fans and lovers, ecosystem movers and shakers, blockchain salt and pepper and crypto sellers and hodlers at ETHDenver.

And each year, Apillon showcases additional features and improved UX of the platform and displays even bigger plans for the future.


We feel ETHDenver is our inception ground because so many connections and possibilities we’ve accumulated at ETHDenver have materialized through great partnerships, awesome cooperations, and other numerous joint efforts to bring the Web3 future closer to the present.


### Apillon’s blueprint for ETHDenver 2024

There will be quite a few side events going on, and Apillon will be at:


#### 1. Polkadot MiniSummit — February 28


A 4-hour tech-filled gathering for a smooth introduction to the Polkadot ecosystem will deliver technical talks, hands-on demos, dedicated networking and socializing over pizza and drinks.


Apillon’s own Tadej Vengust (CTO) will disclose dark secrets of Web3 coding in his talk “BUIDL Web3 with Typescript”.
