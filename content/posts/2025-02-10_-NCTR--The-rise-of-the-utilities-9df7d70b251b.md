Big things are happening at Apillon, and we’re here to let you in on it. Over the past two and a half years, we’ve been heads-down, building, testing, and expanding across multiple parachains — making sure our product isn’t just good, but rock-solid and ready for adoption.


The numbers don’t lie: while we’re still in the early days, developers are paying attention, which tells us we’re on the right track.


We’re taking the next big step: bringing $NCTR deeper into the Apillon ecosystem to unlock new utilities and level up community engagement.


Let’s dive in.

With Gal at the helm, here’s what you can expect:


Gal will work closely with the team to bring more transparency, engagement, and collaboration to the community. This is just the beginning of our renewed focus on strengthening our connection with you!
