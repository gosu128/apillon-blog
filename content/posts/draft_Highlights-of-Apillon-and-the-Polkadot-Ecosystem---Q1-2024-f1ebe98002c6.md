Key insights


Relay Chain


The Polkadot Relay Chain has several primary functions, including securing and connecting the parachains. As such, its end users typically transact and use the network primarily through the parachains. The Relay Chain does support some end user functionality, including token transfers, staking, validator elections, governance voting, and parachain slot auction participation. With RFC-0032: Minimal Relay, it is proposed to migrate several of these subsystems into system parachains.

[Relay Chain](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-architecture#relay-chain)
[Minimal Relay](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/RFCs/blob/main/text/0032-minimal-relay.md#rfc-0032-minimal-relay)

In late October, the DOT locked from the first batch of parachain auctions completed its final unlock, leading to the yearly high of active addresses on October 24th. Address activity continued its positive trajectory in Q1 2024. Returning addresses reached 8,200 (+9% QoQ), new addresses totaled 3,100 (+23% QoQ), bringing active addresses to 11,300 (+12% QoQ).

[Acala](https://twitter.com/AcalaNetwork)

The Cross-Consensus Message Format (XCM) is a standardized messaging format and language that enables seamless communication between parachains and other consensus-driven systems. XCM plays a crucial role in facilitating interoperability and complex cross-consensus interactions. It allows blockchains to exchange messages, perform operations, and transfer assets, among other use cases.

[Cross-Consensus Message Format (XCM)](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-xcm)

In Q1 2024, Polkadot‚Äôs XCM activity continued to increase. Daily XCM transfers reached 2,700, showing an increase of 89% QoQ. Non-asset transfer use cases, termed as ‚ÄúXCM other,‚Äù rose to 185 daily, which is a 214% increase QoQ. The total daily XCM messages were 2,800, up 94% QoQ and 314% over Q3 2023. The number of active XCM channels grew to 230, marking a 13% increase QoQ.

üëâPolkadot Alpha Program, a groundbreaking initiative that lowers entry barriers and fosters a more dynamic environment for teams aiming to bring their blockchain projects to life. The Polkadot Alpha Program comes at a pivotal moment as builders anticipate the arrival of Agile Coretime, when the barriers to launch parachain projects will be considerably reduced. Using ready-made templates and through purchasing coretime, any team can become production-ready in a matter of days. This development means the previous Square One and Substrate Builder Programs, which were dedicated support programs with curated participants, had become less relevant, requiring a refresh. In essence, the Alpha Program was introduced as a unique zero-dependency support line, including resources, community involvement and the opportunity to provide quality feedback on Polkadot‚Äôs core products. It‚Äôs the ideal platform for teams ready to take their projects to the next level. Read more

#### 2.3 KILT¬†Protocol


üëâ The KILT team has completed all milestones of the Polkadot Treasury Grant for developing the Decentralized Identity Provider (DIP), and DIP is now ready for use. Using DIP, any chain can become an identity provider, and any parachain (and, in the future, external chains) can integrate KILT and / or other identity providers for their identity needs.


The Decentralized Identity Provider (DIP) enables a ground-breaking cross-chain decentralized identity system inspired by the functionality of OpenID. This means that parachains requiring an identity solution don‚Äôt need to build their own infrastructure. Instead, they can leverage the infrastructure DIP provides. DIP is open-source, and you can integrate it with existing Polkadot-compatible runtimes with minimal changes and without affecting the fee model of the relying party. Read more
