### Register toÂ Apillon


Apillon is redefining the way developers think of Web3. Registration included.


Contrary to complex practices of signing up to Web3-based products, which include generation of seed phrases and employment of decentralized authentication tools, Apillon makes Web3 more approachable.


You will be able to register to the Apillon platform using simply your email address and a password. This is quite a revolutionary way of approaching Web3 technologies, as it bypasses the complexity of setting up a wallet and navigating self-custodial means of authentication.


Upon registration, you will receive an email containing a link. Clicking on it will activate your account and open the door to the Apillon dashboard.


### Start building or try demoÂ project


Once logged in, youâ€™ll be able to bring your Web3 project idea to life.


Or, if youâ€™re unsure what you want to build yet, you could test the waters first. The fully Web3-compatible website demo will let you try out a few services and main functionalities and walk you through the open-source code.


Letâ€™s say youâ€™re eager to start creating.


You will be able to start a new Web3 project simply by clicking [Start building].


In the following step, you will be encouraged to give your project a character with a name and description. This will help you locate an individual project among many that you will create throughout your Web3 journey with Apillon.


Once your Web3 project has a name, you could start building it with Apillon.


Upon clicking [Start your first project], the Apillon magic will start setting up your Web3 development dashboard.

### Plans andÂ pricing


The Apillon Beta platform was designed to be readily available to all users at a freemium plan. All you will need to do is sign up and start using it.


The freemium plan of the Apillon Beta will come with some limitations, though. These include the number of users that could collaborate on a project, the amount of data managed through an account, etc.


As the platform progresses to improved versions, youâ€™ll be able to upgrade to other packages and employ more features and functionalities to create more nuanced and multifunctional Web3 products.


### What do you need to build Web3 products withÂ Apillon?


Nothing special, really. Your standard web development knowledge and fluency in the most common programming languages (Javascript/Typescript, Python, etc.) will do the job.


The hard work of establishing a connection to Web3 service providers and their technologies on a single dashboard will be done by the Apillon team.


Bring your Web3 project idea to life and build advanced Web3 applications faster and easier.
