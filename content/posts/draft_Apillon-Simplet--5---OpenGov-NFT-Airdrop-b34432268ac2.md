In this post, we will dive into the fifth on the list of prebuilt solutions by Apillon — the OpenGov NFT Airdrop simplet.


As its name suggests, it enables an easy distribution of NFTs to voters on Polkassembly’s OpenGov proposals.

Let’s inspect the bolts and nuts of this simplet and its mechanics.


### What does this simplet do?


This prebuilt solution allows you to hand out NFT rewards as thank-you tokens for voting on the chosen OpenGov proposal.


Next time you seek support from the Polkadot governing community, you can show your appreciation with unique tokens and distribute them automatically to the Aye/Nay voters.


### Where does it come in handy?


The simplet is explicitly built to be used in the Polkassembly’s OpenGov governance environment.


However, if you have advanced knowledge of smart contract coding, you can edit it to be used in other scenarios, too, provided that it operates in a similar way, with users identified via digital wallets.


### Why OpenGov NFT Airdrop simplet?


Given your interest in using a simplet in the Polkadot environment, you might be familiar with the Web3 world and its mechanics.


Even if you’re well versed in Web3 and Polkadot’s blockchain technology, the simplet provides a shortcut to launching a campaign of awarding non-fungible tokens of appreciation to everyone supporting your cause.

### How can you use it?


You can locate the proposal of your interest via its designated number, and choose which voters (Aye or Nay) you wish to reward with NFTs.


Once the relevant voters are listed, you can distribute NFT thank-yous to every one of them.


### How to run this simplet?


To launch this simplet and distribute NFTs to the chosen OpenGov voters, you need to put in place a few things first:

#### But why do you need all these things?


This Apillon simplet, much like the others, is designed as a complete package of Web3/decentralized solutions. As such, it relies on several Apillon-provided decentralized services that should be implemented for the solution to work as intended.


In the case of the OpenGov NFT Airdrop simplet, these are the following:


#### Implementation


The deployment of this simplet consists of two parts: the front end and the back end.


The Vue.js front end can be run on your computer or hosted on any website provider, such as WordPress. It’s, however, advisable you host it on your server of choice in a completely decentralized way using Apillon’s Web3 Hosting service.

As for the Node.js back end, you can run it locally on your computer or, if you prefer, use a tool called Docker and customize configuration files with your campaign’s information, such as NFT details and email server data.
