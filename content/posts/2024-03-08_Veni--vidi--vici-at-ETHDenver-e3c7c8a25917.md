### Veni, vidi, vici at ETHDenver


#### The Apillon team left no stone unturned in networking with the dev community—new partnerships, collaborations, and tech upgrades are in the works.


ETHDenver was all over Apillon’s mood board for the past couple of weeks. A week for preparing talks, presentations, and new merch, another one to put all that tech, content and rolling papers to good use. And how was it?

#### The Apillon team worked their SaaS off…


It was the best ETHDenver experience so far; we were on fire, and the Apillon platform was like hot buns for hungry devs (we wanted to say, “The platform couldn’t keep up,” but that’s just not the case; sorry, not sorry.)

As the start of ETHDenver coincidentally marked the start of Apillon’s $NCTR Airdrop, we also announced it at the Polkadot booth, where we rocked the stage and attracted more audience than ever. If you missed it by any chance, here is the break-down:

And the Polkadot booth day in general, you ask? A blast, as always! Walk with us through our first day on ETHDenver and check out some proof of life by the Apillon team.

Tadej Vengust, CTO at Apillon, starred as one of the MiniSummit’s speakers and presented how to “#BUIDL Web3 with Typescript”. Photo and video evidence on display below — and if anyone would like to receive the original presentation straight from the master himself, please leave a comment 🤓

#### ETHDenver, you’ve been great — all over again!


Thank you! It’s now time to regroup, make battle plans, sleep a little, and put the battle plans to reality. Then, we’ll tell you all about the newest features, plans for upgrades and future endeavors.


Nobody summed it up better than Polkadot so we are just going to leave this here 👇


If you want to start building Web3 right now or you just want to check out the $NCTR Airdrop, the Apillon platform is your oyster.
