Patrik: When we‚Äôre preaching about abstracting the complexity, that‚Äôs what we have in mind. Sending assets directly to your web3name-linked accounts is a step towards ‚Äúmaking transactions easier (to je za malo dodelati)‚Äù.


Watch out, as there might be more news coming out.


### Barrier to entry to¬†Web3


Friction, digital wallets, need to understand/be familiar with Web3 tech/tools, time consuming, frustrating


legacy login methods: social login, google account login


drawbacks: less privacy, data breaches, centralized control over user data


### Web3 login¬†methods


MetaMask, digital wallets, mobile wallets, etc.


friction, difficult to onboard people that don‚Äôt care about/dislike Web3, lengthy process


In summary, while Web3 login methods are commonly used to access Web3 apps, there are alternative ways to interact with the blockchain such as using a hosted or local Web3 provider or allowing users to connect their own Web3 provider.


Web3-based apps typically use decentralized login options that allow users to interact with the app without relying on traditional username and password authentication. Some common login options for Web3-based apps include:


1. Metamask: Metamask is a popular browser extension that allows users to interact with Web3-based apps using their Ethereum wallet. When users access a Web3-based app that supports Metamask, they can sign transactions and provide authentication through their Metamask wallet.


2. WalletConnect: WalletConnect is an open-source protocol that allows users to connect their mobile or hardware wallets to Web3-based apps. This option is useful for users who prefer to use their mobile wallets to interact with Web3-based apps.


3. Coinbase Wallet: Coinbase Wallet is a mobile wallet app that supports Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies. It can be used to sign transactions and authenticate with Web3-based apps that support Coinbase Wallet.


4. Fortmatic: Fortmatic is a user-friendly Web3 wallet that allows users to sign transactions and authenticate with Web3-based apps using their email address and a password. This option is useful for users who prefer a simpler login process that doesn‚Äôt require a cryptocurrency wallet.


5. Hardware wallets: Hardware wallets such as Ledger and Trezor can also be used to authenticate with Web3-based apps, providing an extra layer of security for users who want to keep their private keys offline.


Overall, the choice of login options for Web3-based apps depends on the specific needs and preferences of users, as well as the requirements of the app itself.


### Account abstraction


Account abstraction is a concept in Web3 that refers to the ability to separate the management of cryptocurrency accounts from the underlying blockchain. In other words, it allows developers to create smart contracts that can interact with any kind of account, regardless of the specific blockchain technology being used.


Traditionally, blockchain networks require users to manage their own accounts and pay transaction fees in the native cryptocurrency of the network. With account abstraction, developers can create smart contracts that abstract away these details and instead allow users to pay fees in any cryptocurrency they choose, or even in non-cryptocurrency assets such as fiat currency or tokens on other blockchains.


This is achieved through a combination of new programming languages, such as Solidity, and innovative protocols like the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which allow smart contracts to interact with multiple types of accounts.


Account abstraction has the potential to make blockchain technology more accessible and user-friendly, as it allows developers to create more complex and sophisticated decentralized applications (DApps) that are easier for end users to interact with.

The KILT protocol is a blockchain infrastructure that enables the creation of self-sovereign identity (SSI) systems. One of the key features of the KILT protocol is its ability to enable account abstraction, which is a mechanism that allows users to interact with a blockchain network using different account types.


Account abstraction is achieved through the use of a concept called ‚Äúclaims,‚Äù which are assertions made by issuers about a specific attribute of an identity. For example, a claim could be made that an identity is over the age of 18, or that the identity has a specific certification or degree.


The KILT protocol enables account abstraction by allowing claims to be associated with different types of accounts. This means that users can interact with the blockchain network using different types of accounts, depending on the specific claims they need to make.


For example, a user could create a ‚Äúvoting account‚Äù that is associated with a claim about their citizenship status. When the user votes in an election, the claim associated with their voting account is checked to ensure that they are eligible to vote.


Similarly, a user could create an ‚Äúinsurance account‚Äù that is associated with a claim about their driving record. When the user applies for car insurance, the claim associated with their insurance account is checked to determine their risk level and premium.


In summary, the KILT protocol enables account abstraction by allowing claims to be associated with different types of accounts. This allows users to interact with the blockchain network using different account types, depending on the specific claims they need to make.

### 1. Native Account Abstraction‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääby zkSync¬†Era


Amazing UX is a must for mass adoption, and it‚Äôs not conceivable without native account abstraction. While EIP-4337 is a big step in the right direction for Ethereum, it‚Äôs not enough.

[Amazing UX is a must for mass adoption](https://zksync.io/ux)

Here is why:


a) It introduces a dependency on 3rd party intermediaries;


b) Crucially, it does not work for the majority of Ethereum users (because most accounts are EOAs).

[EOA](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/accounts/#types-of-account)

zkSync Era, on the other hand, has had native account abstraction from day one, which solves both of these problems. For example, any account on Era can pay fees in any tokens or even transact with zero fees on protocols willing to subsidize usage.

To bring about mass adoption, we need better UX.


Native account abstraction gives developers UX superpowers to bring [more] users to Web3.


By upgrading users from externally owned accounts (EOAs) to smart contract accounts (CAs), you can build experiences that abstract away seed phrases, schedule and automate payemnts, and pay gas fees in any token‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääor even pay the gas on a user‚Äôs behalf.


No seed phrases. Abstract away private keys and seed phrases prone to getting lost or being hacked. Account abstraction (AA) enables biometric verification and social recovery via family, friends or a selected third party. Users can sign into Ethereum with their Web2 profile and customize permissions for at an individual app level.


Paying fees in any token. Eliminate the friction of funding new wallets with ETH to start transacting. Allow gas payments in ERC-20s or offset gas fees for users.


Batching complex actions together. Previously, users had to manually approve each contract approval and transaction, creating unnecessary friction and adding fees. With AA, users can batch multiple operations and sign all of them once. This makes dapp interactions cheaper and faster since it means just once state change on L1.


Uninterrupted user experience. Until today, immersive on-chain entertainment experiences were impossible because every interaction needed signing. Now users can sign once to start sessions with a preset time and value limits, then make as many interactions as they want within those parameters.


Automatic payments. Automatic payments always relied on non-custodial accounts with an exchange or third party. Not anymore. Users can create automatic and scheduled transfers, recurring payment subscriptions, and other applications that are impossible today‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääall while retaining self custody.


‚ÄúAccount abstraction turns every account into a smart contract with its own logic. This is huge because it enables everyone to have an account adapted to their needs, making crypto secure and easy for everyone with seamless compatibility.‚Äù Argent


Account abstraction in a blockchain system refers to separating the control of an account from its associated private key. This allows an account to be controlled by a smart contract rather than simply a private key.


Account abstraction is the proposal to allow users to use smart contract wallets instead of EOAs. This completely removes any need for users to use EOAs in order to perform transactions.


Account abstraction is a blockchain system paradigm in which smart contracts exclusively hold assets, not externally-owned accounts (EOAs).


The Status Quo


Account abstraction in a blockchain system refers to separating the control of an account from its associated private key. This allows an account to be controlled by a smart contract rather than simply a private key. The smart contract representing the account will still likely require signatures from one or more private keys in order to perform certain activities, but others can be delegated to the smart contract based on predefined logic.


This powerful concept enables developers to build complex decentralized applications that were not possible before. With account abstraction, smart contracts can interact with other smart contracts in a trustless and secure manner without the need for a central authority to mediate the transaction.


Account abstraction also allows for new types of transactions to be created. For example, with account abstraction, a smart contract can pay transaction fees on behalf of a user, or a smart contract can bundle multiple transactions together, reducing the overall transaction cost.


The Benefits


The introduction of account abstraction has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with blockchain systems. It allows for a more flexible and efficient blockchain ecosystem supporting a wide range of decentralized applications.


One of the most significant benefits of account abstraction is that it creates more sophisticated smart contracts. Therefore, this means that smart contracts can execute more complex logic, interact with other smart contracts, and even hold assets on behalf of users.


Account abstraction also enables more sophisticated and secure self-custodial wallets and wallet recovery.


The Risks


Despite the benefits of account abstraction, there are also some potential drawbacks to consider. For example, it can make tracing the flow of funds within a blockchain system more challenging. It can also introduce new attack vectors that malicious actors could exploit.


To mitigate these risks, it is essential to implement robust security measures and conduct thorough testing before deploying any smart contracts that use account abstraction.
