Working with raw blockchain data can feel like searching for a needle in a haystack — if the haystack kept growing every 10 seconds. It’s time-consuming, inefficient, and a massive roadblock for developers who just want to build amazing Web3 applications.


Apillon recognized the power of streamlined blockchain data, which is why SQD’s indexing service is seamlessly integrated into the Apillon dashboard. Think of it as giving your dapp a shortcut through the chaos — direct access to organized, pre-indexed blockchain data, all in one place. No more endless queries or babysitting nodes — just clean, reliable data, ready when you are, right from Apillon.

### What is indexing, and why does it matter?


Think of blockchain indexing as building a GPS for your data. Instead of wandering aimlessly through blocks and transactions, indexing gives you a clear map of the information you need.


Here’s why it’s a game-changer:


This isn’t just about saving time — it’s about unlocking the full potential of your dapp.


### SQD indexing: Your data’s new best friend


#### Fast and frictionless queries


Blockchain data is heavy, but SQD lightens the load with pre-indexed datasets that allow instant access to blocks, transactions, and smart contract data. It’s the speed boost your dapp didn’t know it needed.


#### Scalable and stress-free


Running your own node? Sounds great until you’re drowning in maintenance costs and constant syncing. Indexers takes care of the heavy lifting so you can focus on scaling your app — not your headaches.


#### Real-time updates, no lag


With SQD, your dapp gets data in near real-time. From transaction confirmations to wallet balances, everything stays synced, smooth, and ready to go.


### Why developers love SQD indexing?

Institutional organizations like NGOs, that handle complex data workflows without as many hands on deck as would need to? Yes, yes, you are all invited and you’ll soon see the light at the end of that dark data tunnel. And it won’t be the train, we promise you that.
