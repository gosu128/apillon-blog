### 5 things about Polkadot that were discussed at BlockSplit


#### Apillon‚Äôs back from BlockSplit where we presented easy Web3 building with the Apillon platform to blockchain enthusiasts.


That‚Äôs it, another edition of BlockSplit is behind us! Besides Apillon‚Äôs CEO rocking the main stage of the Mediterannean blockchain conference and Apillon‚Äôs CPO presenting a demo of the Apillon platform to builders and Web3 enthusiasts, we spent most of our time representing the Polkadot crowd at the Apillon booth, talking to builders, designers, thinkers, crypto and blockchain enthusiasts.

As we were discussing all things Web3, Polkadot, and easy building on the Apillon platform with the participants, we noticed that those new to the ecosystem, even some of the experienced developers, still aren‚Äôt very familiar with what sets Polkadot Network apart from other blockchains.


If you hang with us until the end of this blog, we‚Äôll share 5 things all developers should remember about Polkadot‚Äôs cutting-edge technology.

#### Day 1: Polkadot in use and the best afterparty in¬†Split


Apillon kicked off BlockSplit at Polkadot in use, a community-driven event organized in cooperation with Astar Network, Bifrost, HydraDX, and ChainSafe Systems.

CPO at Apillon, Nino Kutnjak, offered a detailed demo of the Apillon platform that showed the participants how Apillon translates Polkadot‚Äôs parachains into simple APIs, offering builders an easy way to use Web3 services.

After we learned what new use cases Polkadot ecosystem teams are working on, we closed the night on the venue‚Äôs rooftop, where the views were almost as memorable as the company we kept.


#### Day 2: Time to take over the main¬†stage

On the main stage, CEO at Apillon, Matja≈æ Soboƒçan, delivered a key talk with a focus on how the Apillon platform helps developers overcome challenges they face when entering the blockchain space.

He explained how the platform harnesses the power of Polkadot‚Äôs parachains, including Phala Network, Crust Network, KILT Protocol, and Moonbeam Network, via simple APIs.


What else did we do in Split? Besides enjoyed the Mediterranean air and the vibrant culture, we spent much of the time simply talking to the participants, including experienced and new developers, graphic designers with interest in blockchain technology, crypto enthusiasts, you name it.


One thing they all had in common? They all seemed to love Apillon merch.


#### 5 technical advantages of Polkadot¬†Network


Thanks for bearing with us ‚Äòtill the end! Now, here‚Äôs what really stuck with us after the three wonderful days we spent at BlockSplit: there are still developers and builders out there who are missing out on the building potential of Polkadot Network. Let‚Äôs change that!


There are five main innate features of Polkadot that make this cutting-edge technology superior to many single blockchains.


#### üëâNumber 1: Scalability


Polkadot Network is comprised of multiple specialized blockchains, called parachains, that can run in parallel as they‚Äôre all connected to the main relay chain. This means that Polkadot‚Äôs architecture can process multiple transactions and smart contracts simultaneously.


#### üëâNumber 2: Interoperability


Polkadot enables different blockchains to communicate and share information seamlessly. Through its relay chain, Polkadot facilitates the transfer of assets and messages between parachains, enabling cross-chain interoperability.


#### üëâNumber 3: Governance


Polkadot incorporates a robust governance mechanism that allows stakeholders to participate in the decision-making process. This democratic approach enhances the platform‚Äôs adaptability to new innovative technology.


#### üëâNumber 4:¬†Security


Polkadot places a strong emphasis on security. By utilizing a shared security model, Polkadot‚Äôs relay chain provides a high level of protection to all connected parachains.


#### üëâNumber 5: Upgradeability


Unlike many other blockchains, Polkadot is designed to be upgradeable without causing major disruptions or hard forks. Polkadot Network can adapt to emerging technologies, incorporate new features, and address potential issues efficiently.
