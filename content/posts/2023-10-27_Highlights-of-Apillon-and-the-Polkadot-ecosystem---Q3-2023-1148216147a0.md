### Highlights of Apillon and the Polkadot ecosystem‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäQ3¬†2023


#### Apillon platform upgrades and increasing adoption, along with complementary solutions developed with ecosystem partners, added their share to the consistent growth of the Polkadot¬†space.

[1 Apillon](#32fe)
[2 Polkadot ecosystem](#c5c7)

With Q3 well behind us now, we‚Äôre taking a page of the Medium space to retrospect on what Apillon, partner parachains, and the Polkadot ecosystem achieved in the past few months.


### 1 Apillon


For the big part of the past three-month period, the Apillon team was focused on the revised Polkadot Proposal #161, a thorough revamp of the apillon.io website, and upgrades to the Apillon dashboard UX.

[1.1 Platform integrations & Web3 Services](#846f)
[1.2 Adoption](#34cd)
[1.3 Features & functionalities](#723f)
[1.4 Events](#8532)
[1.5 Community](#bf33)

Let‚Äôs start from the core‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe Apillon dashboard.


#### 1.1 Platform integrations & Web3¬†Services


üîó After integrating KILT Protocol‚Äôs decentralized authentication service to enable wallet-based log-in on the Apillon dashboard, the team is fast approaching the release of the Web3 Authentication service. KILT-powered Web3 Auth would offer users a plug-and-play way to integrate decentralized identity and authentication into their Web3 projects and even equip digital assets with DIDs.

[KILT Protocol](https://blog.apillon.io/apillon-to-integrate-decentralized-authentication-from-kilt-protocol-8990fcdeed6d)

üîó Similarly, following the integration of Phala‚Äôs computing logic in Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs NFT, this parachain‚Äôs extended capabilities of decentralized computing are making their way to the Apillon platform to become available in a streamlined manner.

[stay tuned](https://t.me/Apillon)

#### 1.2 Adoption


After a somewhat steadier Q2, the third quarter of the year released the brakes, and the increased user interest in faster Web3 development resulted in higher spikes on charts.


The Apillon dashboard welcomed 42% more users compared to the previous three-month period. On average, the platform thus saw more daily signups than before, with a new user starting their Web3 journey with Apillon every 10 hours.


üìä Total users on the platform (updated: Nov 10, 2023): 1.074üìä New users per day on average: 2.4


And they didn‚Äôt just stop at the door. They went in, played around, and channeled quite some activity through Apillon, building the next big Web3 thing or just testing the waters.


With 48.842 server requests, user engagement was stable every week, and steadily increased month by month.


Compared to Q2 (22.761 server requests) and Q1 (15.576), developers intensified their Q3 keyboard-hitting spree with a 215% and 314% increase, respectively.


To date, the Apillon platform accounted for 82.506 server requests in total, demonstrating its hands-on utility and essential role in the Web3 building ecosystem. With new features and development options rolling in, the analytics landscape will likely steepen further.


And, to complement the stats of new users and their activity, Apillon started tracking IPFS traffic, too. Despite its chronological limitations, the data shows consistent use of Apillon-powered file transfer to IPFS via Crust Network, the pillar of the Web3 Storage and Web3 Hosting services.


#### 1.3 Features & functionalities


As a one-stop-shop for Web3 services, the Apillon platform was designed to not only facilitate advanced technical possibilities, but also to ensure optimal user experience regardless of programming background.


üîë React and Vue-based templates were added to Apillon‚Äôs NFT website template library on GitHub, topping the initial JavaScript-based template and bringing greater flexibility to designing fully decentralized NFT-showcasing websites.

[React and Vue](https://medium.com/apillon/react-and-vue-join-javascript-in-apillons-nft-website-template-library-939005ac8770)
[GitHub](https://github.com/Apillon)

üîë The Apillon development team successfully reached Milestone 2 of the Substrate Builders Program and finalized another chapter in the SBP-backed pursuit of product‚Äôs technical expansion.

[Milestone 2 of the Substrate Builders Program](https://medium.com/apillon/reviewed-and-approved-vol-2-apillons-progress-did-not-go-unnoticed-8eb2495af16b)

üîë Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs NFT for unlocking encrypted files with NFT key embodied three Polkadot parachains‚Äô capabilities and demonstrated the use of cryptographic NFT keys in various scenarios.

[Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs NFT](https://medium.com/apillon/schr%C3%B6dingers-nft-unlock-encrypted-files-with-nft-key-eeab55ae6bdf)

üîë Apillon launched w3ndi, a w3n-based digital address index, in collaboration with KILT Protocol. w3ndi first launched on Nova Wallet to deliver easy contact browsing and selection based on KILT‚Äôs DIDs for faster crypto transfers. See üëâ w3ndi guide

New website


For all the newcomers as well as the Web3 veterans seeking more information on the world of possibilities with Apillon, the apillon.io website now dons its best look so far.

[apillon.io](https://apillon.io/)
[https://apillon.io/](https://apillon.io/)

But it‚Äôs not just about what meets the eye. In numerous instances, it conveys the message of the new-gen Web3 building method through videos, tutorials, solutions, and even recipes.


Web3 Recipes


True to the name, Apillon‚Äôs Web3 Recipes are condensed tutorials guiding users through the process of creating various Web3 delicacies using the Apillon dashboard‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääfrom a decentralized alternative to a popular video platform to an online game with a Web3 backbone.


If you lack inspiration or just want to play around with certain Web3 ingredients, skim through the distilled list of ideas or deep-dive into the first couple of long-form guides (more to come!).

#### 1.4 Events


The Apillon team was active on a couple of occasions where the developer community got together in search of new aha moments, inspiration, and possibly an extended list of contacts.


üìç At sub0 2023, the Polkadot Developer Conference, the word of Apillon was spread twice‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääfirst, CTO Tadej Vengust took the Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs NFT prototype to the stage, and second, Apillon‚Äôs Showcase Station demonstrated what the platform has to offer to users first-hand.

[sub0 2023](https://medium.com/apillon/apillons-coming-to-sub0-2023-166e5dfcb017)

üìç Fast forward a couple of weeks, it was time to bring the developer crowd under our very own roof. Apillon hosted 50 Shades of NFTs, the latest in the series of Polkadot-oriented events in Ljubljana, Slovenia. The talks touched upon different aspects of NFTs, from applications in the art world to technical capabilities and new opportunities for developers to bridge the tangible and digital worlds.

[2.6 Astar Network](#631b)

#### 2.1 Polkadot


The vigorous development energy of the Polkadot Network was going strong, with new users flocking in daily in four-digit numbers. The landscape of daily new accounts registered on Polkadot in Q3 resembled the trend of Q2; similarly, the number of daily active accounts.

[Polkadot Network](https://polkadot.network/)

Some spikes, however, were noticeable, with 25k active accounts registered in mid-September. Based on the number of all public key addresses in the ecosystem, Polkadot now hosts over 4.3m users.

[over 4.3m users](https://polkadot.network/blog/five-new-parachains-staking-growth-technical-upgrades-as-polkadot-expansion-continues/#polkadot%E2%80%99s-growth-in-statistics)

Taking into account all on-chain events across all parachains, the network has hosted over 190m events to date, while Polkadot repositories registered more than 49,000 GitHub code commits.
