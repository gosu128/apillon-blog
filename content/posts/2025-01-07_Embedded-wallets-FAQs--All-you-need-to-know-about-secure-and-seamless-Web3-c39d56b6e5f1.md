Web3 can feel like an exclusive club with a dress code of advanced blockchain knowledge. But with Apillon, weâ€™re opening the doors wide.


Our embedded wallets are here to make your Web3 journey simple, safe, and downright funâ€Šâ€”â€Šno tech degree required. For devs and for users.


### 1. What even are embeddedÂ wallets?


Embedded wallets are like your backstage pass to Web3, your all-access ticket to the dapps and activities you love. They are an upgraded version of the sign-in processes weâ€˜re used to, but way safer, thanks to blockchain tech. Built right into apps, they let you skip the downloads, avoid the setup drama and dive straight into the fun. Easy, right?


Weâ€™ve written about the nuts and bolts of embedded wallets in this blog right here. Feel free to read more about it ðŸ‘‡

[Embedded walletsâ€Šâ€”â€ŠWhat are they and how Apillon redefines the conceptApillonâ€™s embedded wallet on Oasis Network combines a seamless UX of Web2 onboarding, high security of hardwareâ€¦blog.apillon.io](https://blog.apillon.io/embedded-wallets-what-are-they-and-how-apillon-redefines-the-concept-4479a8dd28bd)

Embedded wallet is just one of the terms that describes a concept where wallets are seamlessly integrated into applications, making the user experience more intuitive and frictionless. Other terms are embedded accounts, wallet as a service, e-mail wallets, smart wallets, in-app wallets, social wallet, Web3 wallet, in some cases also account abstraction.


### 2. And whatâ€™s the deal with account abstraction?


The term account abstraction sounds like a tech buzzword, and in some ways, it actually is. Itâ€™s an ERC-4337 standard that lets smart contracts act as wallets, making transactions customizable and opening up new possibilities for developers.


But at Apillon, weâ€™re not about the complexity. We take the idea of account abstraction and turn it into something tangible: simpler, smarter wallets that work for everyday users. No tech standards or jargonâ€Šâ€”â€Šjust easy-to-use solutions.


### 3. How does Apillon make wallets less of a headache?


By taking the chaos out of Web3.


Imagine decluttering your digital life. No more wrestling with private keys or worrying about gas fees when dealing with Web3. Weâ€™ve cut out the messy bits so you can focus on what matters: using dapps, making transactions, and flexing in Web3 without needing a PhD. Plus, you wonâ€™t need to explain blockchain to your friends. Or even think about itâ€Šâ€”â€Šit just works.


Want to try it out? Go to the Apillon platform and use an embedded wallet in your dapp.


### 4. Why should anyone care about simplerÂ wallets?


Itâ€™s like swapping your grandmaâ€™s flip phone for a sleek smartphone. Everythingâ€™s easier, faster, and just makes sense. For users, itâ€™s less face-palming and eye-rolling action. For devs, itâ€™s building stuff your friends and users actually want to use. Simpler wallets mean more people can join the Web3 party. Everywhere.


### 5. Should I be a blockchain expert to use Apillonâ€™s wallets?


Nope. Thatâ€™s the whole point. Weâ€™ve done the hard work so you can vibe with Web3 without sweating over cryptography or losing your private key in some dark corner of your Notes app.


Weâ€™re here for practical, not perfect.


### 6. Is Apillonâ€™s wallet setupÂ safe?


Yep! Just because weâ€™ve trimmed the complexity doesnâ€™t mean weâ€™ve skipped security. Your wallet stays locked down, and you donâ€™t have to worry about any funny business. Think of it as a vault with a really nice user interface.


### 7. What can developers do with Apillonâ€™s embeddedÂ wallets?


Devs can make their apps Web3-ready without breaking a sweat. Think of our embedded wallets as plug-and-play magic. Weâ€™ve done the heavy lifting, so you donâ€™t have to reinvent the wheel. Just slot it in, and bam, your dappâ€™s gor Web3 superpowers. Less code for you, more cool forâ€¦ well, everyone.


### 8. What can users do with Apillonâ€™s embeddedÂ wallets?


For users, itâ€™s all about seamless experiences. Use dapps, send crypto, explore Web3â€Šâ€”â€Šall without feeling like youâ€™re in a computer science class. Itâ€™s Web3 made easy, so you can focus on what you love doing.
