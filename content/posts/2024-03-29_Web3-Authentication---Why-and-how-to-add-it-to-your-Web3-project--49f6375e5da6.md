### Web3 Authentication‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäWhy and how to add it to your Web3¬†project?


#### With Apillon, the KILT-powered decentralized identity and authentication feature can be easily integrated into your website or¬†dapp.

### Web3 Authentication


For various reasons, a large share of websites, apps and online platforms require user authentication.


While until recently, the only way to do that was via Web2, centralized options, the new generation of the Internet offers a better way‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääusing decentralized authentication protocols. These protocols ensure greater data security and grant users sovereignty over their credentials.


With Apillon, this option has become widely accessible to everyone who knows how to make their site communicate via APIs.


#### Powered by KILT¬†Protocol


With Apillon, you can integrate a decentralized authentication feature to your website or app, using a decentralized identifier (DID) stored on the KILT parachain.

[KILT parachain](https://www.kilt.io/)

KILT-powered decentralized user identity is verified through user-provided credentials attested by Apillon or SocialKYC.


Any user of your website or app can generate their own decentralized identity, verify their email address through Apillon‚Äôs OAuth protocol, and use the identity to access your site while being fully in charge of their credentials.

[Apillon‚Äôs OAuth protocol](#dc61)

#### Apillon‚Äôs OAuth¬†protocol


The OAuth protocol allows you to integrate OAuth authentication simply and fast via the Apillon API.


There are two steps to this process:


1. The client-side JavaScript code opens an OAuth window for users to authenticate. The code can be found here and contains the following key functions:

[here](https://github.com/Apillon/oauth-demo/blob/main/client/js/script.js)
[https://oauth.apillon.io](https://oauth.apillon.io)

2. The server-side code generates an OAuth session and attests a user‚Äôs credentials. It‚Äôs located here and sets up an Express.js server via two routes:

[here](https://github.com/Apillon/oauth-demo/blob/main/server/server.js)

With everything in place from the server directory, the only thing left to do is to run npm install and npm start to start the server on port 3000.

### Apillon‚Äôs Web3 Authentication flow


The Web3 Authentication service on the Apillon dashboard represents an easy way to equip your project or website with a decentralized authentication approach using a decentralized identifier (DID).

[Web3 Authentication](https://wiki.apillon.io/web3-services/5-web3-authentication.html)

The service is powered by KILT Protocol and KILT‚Äôs Sporran wallet.

[KILT Protocol](https://blog.apillon.io/apillon-to-integrate-decentralized-authentication-from-kilt-protocol-8990fcdeed6d)

Before integrating a KILT-powered decentralized authentication feature into your Web3 project, you should understand the crucial steps involved.


#### Email Verification


When a user interacts with your website, the Apillon OAuth pop-up window initiates the OAuth process.


To generate a decentralized identity, a user should provide their email, which serves two purposes:


#### Account Generation


The user also needs a KILT-based Sporran wallet installed and a user account created.


Their account‚Äôs address is derived from a BIP39 mnemonic‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthis serves as the master key granting them access to the account, hence it should be stored securely.


#### Identity Generation


Next, the user should create a DID‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa unique decentralized identifier by KILT‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääby signing a request in the Sporran wallet.


They should also link their DID with their KILT account so they can later retrieve a DID for it and vice-versa.


#### Account Attestation


There are two steps to attest an account in a decentralized fashion and by revealing only the user data relevant to your website.


Once verification is completed, Apillon‚Äôs OAuth pop-up informs your website of the OAuth flow completion and provides an authentication token. This token can be used by your site to verify the user‚Äôs identity through Apillon‚Äôs API.


Now, you can grant user access to your site based on their Apillon account‚Äôs email address, which ensures that they have successfully verified their identity using verifiable credentials attested by Apillon.


#### DID and Verifiable Credential Storage


Once the credential is successfully generated, the user should save the generated files. The credential could also be imported into the Sporran wallet for convenience and safekeeping.


#### Identity Revocation


Upon request, a user‚Äôs DID can also be revoked through Apillon‚Äôs OAuth website.


After an email with a unique token is sent to the user, a revocation operation for the user‚Äôs DID document is issued to the blockchain, rendering the identity invalid.


This also makes all verifiable credentials associated with the user unusable. However, the wallet account that the user has generated in the registration process remains valid, as well as all tokens associated with that account address.


#### Credential Restore


In case a user loses access to their credentials, they can also restore them through Apillon‚Äôs OAuth website.


After a unique token is sent to the user‚Äôs email and clicked, the user regains access to their saved credentials on a secure site.


#### Credential Verification


Upon next login or access to your website, the user can prove their identity in two ways:

To integrate a decentralized registration and log-in option using a verifiable credential via a simple API, follow the steps below. üëá


### Step-by-step integration


With Apillon, KILT-based decentralized user authentication is at your fingertips.


On your Apillon account dashboard, you can find step-by-step instructions under the Authentication service in the menu on the left.

[Authentication](https://app.apillon.io/dashboard/service/authentication)

Let‚Äôs begin.


To integrate the feature into your Web3 project or website, you need to connect via an API key.


Go to Project settings under your avatar image in the top right corner to generate one.


Under the API keys tab, click ‚ÄúGenerate new key‚Äù.


In the pop-up on the right, enter the API key name to distinguish it from others and toggle the Authentication service. Be sure to check all permissions, including the Execute permissions option.


Click ‚ÄúGenerate‚Äù. Once the API key is generated, a pop-up appears with its details, including the API key secret‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääyou should store it safely since it will enable your website or project to interact with Apillon‚Äôs Authentication API, create OAuth sessions, and verify user log-ins.


Click ‚ÄúI‚Äôve saved API key secret‚Äù, and you‚Äôre good to go.


Now, the fun part begins.


Go to Apillon Wiki‚Äôs OAuth Integration section and use the code snippets to integrate the decentralized authentication service into your website, project, or dapp.
