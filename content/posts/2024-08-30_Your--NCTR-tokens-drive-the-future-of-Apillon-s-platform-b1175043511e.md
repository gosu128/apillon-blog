### Your $NCTR tokens drive the future of Apillon’s platform


#### By holding $NCTR, you can now propose changes and vote on key decisions for the platform’s growth and expansion.


Apillon’s native $NCTR token is more than just a pretty face in your wallet. It was designed as a multi-faceted and widely used asset, covering a range of cases for both platform users and community members.


### More voices, better progress, brighter NCTR prospects


We’ve always known that the best products are shaped by those who use them every day. As we continue improving and upgrading the Apillon platform, your word, insights, and ideas are more crucial than ever.


We’re not just building software. We’re building a future where your contributions can shape the very tools you rely on.


With each improvement, we’re opening the door for more innovators to join Web3, making every contribution increasingly valuable. In time, in resources, in tokens.


### The TownHall meeting point


So, we have designed a system where the Apillon community can help co-create the platform by voting on features that matter most to them and would be an asset to the platform in the future.


Meet the Apillon Product Governance platform hosted on TownHall.

### Decentralization starts with you


Web3 is all about decentralization and collaboration. Since Apillon’s inception, we have advocated for the platform’s evolution to be democracy-based and vetted by a governing community.


By giving you the power to propose changes and vote on key decisions, we’re ensuring that Apillon evolves in a way that truly reflects the needs and values of its community — a platform that expands in ways that directly serve your needs.


This isn’t just governance; it’s a partnership. Join the conversation!
