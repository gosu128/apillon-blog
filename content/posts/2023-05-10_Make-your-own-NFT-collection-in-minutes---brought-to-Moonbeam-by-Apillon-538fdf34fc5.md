### Make your own NFT collection in minutesâ€Šâ€”â€Šbrought to Moonbeam byÂ Apillon


#### Apillonâ€™s new easy-to-use NFT Service is designed to cut the process short and make it beginner-dev-proof.


The latest digital and cultural phenomenon, NFTs, gained recognition a few years back and hasnâ€™t really encountered a bear cycle yet; itâ€™s still making significant waves. And hereâ€™s Apillon, offering you a simplified way of becoming active in the hype.


Bypassing the complexity behind it, the Apillon NFT service delivers a low-code and a few-click way of launching NFT collections while ensuring safe, permanently accessible storage of pertinent metadata and media. There is also an option to work directly with API keys. So, all grounds and levels covered.


#### Letâ€™s go, become a Web3Â builder!


For all the builders and Web3 enthusiasts, the Apillon platform helps provide the best UX in a drag&drop manner and includes writing only a few lines of code. Radically simplifying the process, Moonbeam-supported Apillon NFT service allows the creation of unstoppable collections of non-fungible assets in minutes and free of charge for the time being.


Moreover, with the platform supporting customization from the first click onwards, every part of the process is in the buildersâ€™ handsâ€Šâ€”â€Šincluding the choice of storage, personalization of the collectionsâ€™ front end, and unstoppable hosting.


So, who is it for? For almost anyone, it just depends on how much help one needs along the way:


If you start now, youâ€™ll be done in no time. All you need is imagination with no limits, the Apillon platform will do the rest with the help of seamless connectivity to supported parachain servicesâ€Šâ€”â€Šstorage and hosting via Crust, smart contracts by Moonbeam.


The NFT-making flow on the Apillon platform consists of three general steps: storing the NFT metadata, composing the NFTs and lastly, deploying, minting and displaying (optional) your NFT collection publicly.


#### Do you need an NFT collection?


Probably not. Yet if youâ€™re looking to expand your Web3 horizons, surround yourself with like-minded tech fans, and meet the global world of other NFT creators this might just be the thing for you.


NFTs can add that unique cherry on top of almost anything. Donâ€™t think of only the art world. NFTs can also bring new possibilities into every industry sector. Establishing ownership over a digital asset can move many boundaries in different directions and ways. Maybe even your wallet!
