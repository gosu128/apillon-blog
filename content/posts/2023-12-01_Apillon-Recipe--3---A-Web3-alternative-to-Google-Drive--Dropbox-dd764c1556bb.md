### Why a Web3 alternative to cloud¬†storage?


It goes without saying‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäDropbox and Google Drive are the staples of cloud storage. We‚Äôve all used them to share files with our friends and colleagues, thanks to their multi-account access and plenty of features that make file management a child‚Äôs play.


In both cases, you get a certain amount of storage space in an online server, depending on your plan.


But, as big-tech products, specific terms apply, and when we submit files to their servers, we also give up some of our authority. Besides, using centralized servers for storing files leaves room‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääalbeit narrow‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääfor single-point hazards.


The Web3 technologies introduce a paradigm that defies reliance on centralized cloud storage platforms. With Apillon, you can create a Web3 file-sharing service that allows you‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääor your platform‚Äôs users‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääto retain greater control over the files, their ownership, and accessibility.


### Web3 file storage‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääin cloud, but decentralized


The leading Apillon service to power your cloud storage platform is Web3 Storage. It implements the technology of Crust Network, a Polkadot parachain that pins files to IPFS nodes around the globe.

[FAQ: Apillon Web3 StorageFind answers to your questions on the Apillon Web3 Storage service, how to store files on a decentralized network, and‚Ä¶blog.apillon.io](https://blog.apillon.io/faq-apillon-web3-storage-c99a9b0e8b12)

The user registration and log-in features are delivered by Apillon Web3 Authentication service powered by KILT Protocol, a Polkadot parachain built around decentralized identity and verification.

[Web3 Authentication | Apillon WikiApillon Wikiwiki.apillon.io](https://wiki.apillon.io/web3-services/5-web3-authentication.html)

Both services can be accessed simply via API and integrated into the client-side interface of either desktop, mobile, or web apps.


#### Architecture


The diagram below illustrates the architecture of the Web3 cloud storage project we‚Äôre building today. üëá


First, you will create a Web3 storage bucket for your project to enable file storage. You will also need the Web3 Authentication service to allow your audience to register an account and log in using their decentralized identities. And finally, using the API key, you will integrate the decentralized features into your project‚Äôs user interface.


#### Back-end logic


While the architecture above does facilitate the intended functionalities of cloud-based file storage, we should add a disclaimer.


Ok, let‚Äôs start assembling the puzzle.


### Step 1: Create a Web3 Storage bucket on¬†Apillon


Register or log in to the Apillon dashboard. In the menu on the left, navigate to Storage and create a new storage bucket by clicking the yellow button.

[Apillon dashboard](https://app.apillon.io/login)
[Storage bucket](https://wiki.apillon.io/web3-services/1-good-to-know.html#storage-buckets)

In the pop-up, enter your bucket name to easily distinguish it from other-purpose decentralized storage buckets. Add a description, too, and click ‚ÄúCreate bucket & continue to management‚Äù.


### Step 2: Add Web3 Authentication service


The newly released Apillon Web3 Authentication service allows you to implement fully decentralized user account registration and log-in for your project users.


Powered by KILT Protocol, it allows you to deliver secure and self-sovereign digital identity registration to all your privacy-aware users via decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and Sporran wallet.

[looks for users](https://medium.com/apillon/guide-log-in-to-apillon-dashboard-using-kilt-decentralized-identity-af2c5b2b054e)

Click ‚ÄúAttach authentication service‚Äù. From there, you will be able to generate an API key.


Dealing with API keys will be described in one of the following steps.


### Step 3: Build a UI for file upload and¬†sync


For your project to work similarly to prevalent cloud storage platforms, it should allow users to upload and sync files automatically.


Whether the platform serves as a desktop, mobile or web app, its client side should be able to connect via Apillon API to support this feature.


For your project‚Äôs client side, you need the following:


If you don‚Äôt have a website design yet, you may use pre-made Apillon templates, such as the NFT website templates available on the Apillon GitHub.

[Apillon GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/Apillon/repositories?type=all)

While these website templates were designed to display NFT collections, their JavaScript, ReactJS, and VueJS frameworks with a wallet-connect component work just as well for your Web3 cloud storage platform.

[JavaScript](https://github.com/Apillon/nft-template)
[ReactJS](https://github.com/Apillon/nft-template-react)
[VueJS](https://github.com/Apillon/nft-template-vue)
[React and Vue join JavaScript in Apillon‚Äôs NFT website template libraryYou can now use NFT website templates in two more languages and customize them to showcase Apillon-minted NFTs.blog.apillon.io](https://blog.apillon.io/react-and-vue-join-javascript-in-apillons-nft-website-template-library-939005ac8770)

Simply clone the GitHub repository of the chosen template and remove the unnecessary parts made for displaying NFTs. Build the front-end and business logic that allows users to drag and drop files onto the platform and send them to Apillon Web3 Storage.


Add also sync logic so that the users always have access to the latest version of their files, regardless of where and when they log in.


### Step 4: Connect UI to Apillon via¬†API


To use API connectivity to Web3 services provided by Apillon and integrate decentralized features to your cloud storage platform, you need an API key.


With Apillon, you can create a single API key that unlocks multiple Web3 services. In this case, you need the Web3 Storage and the Web3 Authentication services.


Go to the Apillon dashboard menu, navigate down to Project settings, and under the API keys tab, click ‚ÄúGenerate new key‚Äù.


In the pop-up window on the right, under Generate new key, name your API key and toggle the services that need API connectivity, namely Authentication and Storage.


Make sure all permissions are checked‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäRead, Write, and Execute.


Once the API key details pop-up appears, save the API key and its secret. You will need it to connect your platform‚Äôs client side with Apillon-provided Web3 services.


You can also click on the three dots on the right of the API key and click Copy API key to clipboard.


That‚Äôs it. You just acquired the key to unlocking Web3 functionalities on your cloud storage platform. Use it in your client-side UI and connect to Apillon-supported Polkadot parachain services.


File storing, owning, and sharing can now be done on a decentralized level and offer greater privacy to its users.


### Step 5: Host your platform via¬†Apillon


Finally, ensure your cloud storage platform stays up and active as long as you want it to, without relying on a centralized hosting provider.


Host it on a decentralized network by pinning its contents to IPFS via Crust. On the Apillon dashboard, navigate to Hosting and click ‚ÄúAdd first website‚Äù.


In the pop-up window, enter the website name‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääfor your reference only on the Apillon platform‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand click Create website.


Under the 1. Upload tab, upload website files from your local drive, and click ‚ÄúDeploy to staging‚Äù to test the outcome before moving it to production.


After the successful deployment to staging, check the details under the 2. Preview tab, including the newly created IPNS link of your website files. If everything works fine, seal the deal by clicking ‚ÄúDeploy to production‚Äù.


Your Web3 cloud storage platform is now hosted decentrally and pinned to IPFS via Crust Network. As long as you have the IPFS link (or IPNS link to ensure editability), you can access your platform and keep it up and running thanks to a network of dozens of individual nodes around the globe.


### Optional: Custom¬†upgrades


Now, if all this was too easy, feel free to turn your cloud storage platform up a notch. Add more Web3 services courtesy of the Apillon platform and deliver a greater user experience with privacy and security in mind.


For example, you could integrate the Web3 Computing service (coming soon) to add file editing or manipulation logic. Or, incorporate the NFT service to encrypt files as transferable NFTs.


Web3 is your oyster. Make the most of it with Apillon.
