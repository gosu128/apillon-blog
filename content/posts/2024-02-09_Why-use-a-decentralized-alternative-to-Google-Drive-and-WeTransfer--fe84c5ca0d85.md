### Why use a decentralized alternative to Google Drive and WeTransfer?


#### If Apillon provides the advantages that upstage the Web2 onesâ€” does it matter if itâ€™s built on blockchain?


Decentralized technologies are not just good-to-have vitamins anymore; they are becoming actual painkillers for today's most notorious painsâ€Šâ€”â€Šdata security and privacy concerns.


However, one of the main challenges in onboarding users to Web3 is the novelty and complexity of decentralized tech. Classic web apps and services we use nowadays have mastered user experience, accessibility, and engagement.


What can we learn from that? Everything!


The good thing is that if Web2 diminishes users' trust for data handling, Web3 is here to restore it. The bad thing is not many people know and use Web3 services in everyday life.


### Cloud storageâ€Šâ€”â€Šwhere it hurts us theÂ most


Where do innovations usually strike first? Where thereâ€™s already mass adoption and people are desperate to make some pains go away. Well, cloud storage is one of humankind's most used services today, be it at work, at home, orâ€¦ well, anywhere.


â€‹The digital era has brought about enormous amounts of data, leading to a growing need for efficient and secure storage solutions. Eventually, we moved on from physical data storage and started relying on centralized cloud systems, storing data either in a central server or data centerâ€Šâ€”â€Šthatâ€™s what was available and considered the newest tech. It still kinda is.


Enter decentralized storage solutions that store data across not one server but a network of computers. This innovative approach, also known as blockchain cloud storage or decentralized cloud storage, promises to solve data ownership issues.


### Web2 popularÂ demand


The most widespread tools for file storing and sharing are, by far, Google Drive and WeTransfer. And oh my god, how great it felt to start using them because life was so easy again.


Itâ€™s just that once you realize why they are free but at the same time not completely free, itâ€™s not great ðŸ˜¶ They can cost you your data and your sanity if anything goes wrong.


Donâ€™t get us wrong. We are all still hardwired to use Google Drive and WeTranfer; weâ€™re just saying they could use some upgrades. In fact, if we didnâ€™t think they provided just the value people needed, we wouldnâ€™t have developed their Web3 versions.


### Apillonâ€Šâ€”â€Šstore it and adoreÂ itâ€¦


On the Apillon platform, thereâ€™s a service called Web3 Storage. It works as a cloud storage, only decentralized. You can upload any file, come back to them quickly, and share them with your friends, family, or coworkers through a link. There are no surprises there.


Oh yeah, except for the fact that you and you alone own that data, nobody can turn off the server and prevent you from accessing itâ€Šâ€”â€Šcause there is no serverâ€Šâ€”â€Šthere cannot be any hacks or breaches, and it can be fully available until you decide against it.


Itâ€™s really easy to use Web3 Storage on the Apillon platform, pinky promise! Just not so widely spread as the versions we use now. Not yet, at least.


Well, hereâ€™s a challengeâ€Šâ€”â€Štry uploading family photos and share it with your family ðŸ‘‡
