With Apillonâ€™s new service, developers get the best of both worlds: flexibility, security, and streamlined processes in the backendâ€Šâ€”â€Šall aligned with the values that make Web3 unique. The future of Web3 computing is here, and itâ€™s decentralized.


So, Web3 builders, may your heads be in the clouds and your feet on the blockchain!


### Current landscape and its challenges


The Web3 world was designed to be decentralized, yet many dapps still rely on traditional, centralized cloud providers (think AWS or Google Cloud) to handle the backend tasks. While these providers offer scalability and efficiency, they hold significant drawbacks: single points of failure, lack of transparency, and the ever-looming risk of downtime or censorship.


On the other hand, many decentralized solutions for backend functions are still in their early stages and lack the robustness of their centralized counterparts. This can result in unpredictable performance, scaling limitations, and potential security gaps.


Until now, fully decentralizing your backend infrastructure often felt like trading one set of issues for another. And this is why Web3 needs fully functional decentralized backend solutions to bridge that gap.

### Acurast: your serverless powerhouse


Acurast is a decentralized cloud, built on open-source principles. By harnessing mobile phones worldwide, it overcomes the limitations of traditional cloud providers. It was Apillonâ€™s first choice for delivering a solution aligned with Web3â€™s core values, offering scalability, top-notch security and unmatched efficiency for its Web3 Cloud function service.

Using Acurastâ€™s Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN) of phones, providing compute power across the globe by the community, Apillon ensures that your cloud functions run in a fully decentralized environment.


This distributed network of compute through mobile phones provides a robust, secure and confidential infrastructure, and it utilizes the advantages of these phones, including the Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) to ensure your code stays tamper-proof and your secrets stay protected.


Plus, these devices pack serious compute power and use way less energy than their centralized peersâ€Šâ€”â€Šwith ample RAM, storage and processing power, Acurast is more than ready to handle your computing needs.

### What Apillon brings to theÂ table


Apillon makes deploying cloud functions to Acurastâ€™s processor network seamless and unstoppable. Developers can run any JavaScript, TypeScript or Node.js codeâ€Šâ€”â€Ša simple script, a cron job or a full backend project. To enhance the developer experience, Apillon equipped the platform with API, SDK, and CLI tools for programmatic deployment and cloud function management.


Each deployment generates a custom HTTPS gateway, enabling job execution via HTTP POST requestsâ€Šâ€”â€Šfamiliar territory for Web2 developers. Developers can also securely add encrypted environment variables, which are protected by the secure chip inside Acurast-powered smartphones. This ensures the tamper-proof execution and cryptographic protection for sensitive data.


With Apillon, developers gain full control over their cloud functions, including live monitoring, success/failure analytics and real-time insights into uptime and latencyâ€Šâ€”â€Šall in a decentralized, Web3-first environment.


### Benefits of Apillonâ€™s Cloud functionÂ service


The question isnâ€™t whether you need cloud functions but how they can enhance your project. They enable developers to run backend code on demand. They are serverless, lightweight, and perfect for processing transactions or interacting with smart contracts.


So, why choose Web3 cloud function service? Here are some of the key advantages:
