### Top 5 RPC providers: features that matter most


#### From speed demons to budget-friendly champs, here’s a deep dive into the top RPC providers. Compare speed, reliability and other benefits.


Choosing the right RPC provider is like swiping through a dating app for your dapp. You want one that’s fast, reliable, and won’t ghost you under pressure. But let’s face it, none of them are perfect — each has its quirks, strengths, and those little “are we sure about this?” moments.


In this guide, we’ll introduce the top RPC providers shaking up Web3, breaking down where they shine and where they could use a glow-up. Spoiler alert: if you’re on Apillon, you’ll want to pay close attention to Dwellir.


### What makes a great RPC provider?


Not all RPC providers are created equal. To find your perfect match, you’ll want to look at:


The right RPC (Remote Procedure Call) provider is crucial for the performance and reliability of your dapp. Each provider offers unique strengths and potential drawbacks. Here’s a detailed look at five leading RPC providers:


### 1. Dwellir


If you’re building on Polkadot or Kusama, Dwellir is the no-brainer RPC provider. It specializes in decentralization without cutting corners on speed or reliability, making it a dream match for devs who value consistency and performance.


Dwellir’s strength lies in its architecture. Its decentralized node infrastructure ensures your dapp stays live and kicking, even during high network activity. Plus, it’s tailor-made for the ecosystems it supports, optimizing every query and transaction for smooth sailing.


Cons: Currently focused on Polkadot and Kusama only, so not ideal for multi-chain projects beyond these ecosystems.


### 2. Alchemy


Think of Alchemy as the high-performance luxury car of RPC providers — it’s fast, polished, and built for Ethereum dapps that need to fly. Developers rave about its lightning-fast query speeds and user-friendly tools, making it easy to integrate and scale.


Cons: Premium pricing can be a hurdle for smaller teams or indie developers. Also, limited to Ethereum and a few other chains, making it less versatile for multi-chain projects.


### 3. Infura


When it comes to legacy players, Infura is the household name every Ethereum developer knows. Its scalability and performance make it the go-to for projects with big ambitions — and bigger traffic.


Cons: First, centralized architecture can be a dealbreaker for projects prioritizing decentralization. Secondly, a heavy focus on Ethereum limits its appeal to developers exploring other chains.


### 4. QuickNode


QuickNode is your globally distributed, speed-first option. Thanks to its worldwide node network, it’s great for developers who need snappy, reliable performance no matter where their users are. Add in built-in analytics, and you’ve got a tool that helps you monitor your dapp like a hawk.


Cons: Pricing escalates quickly as your project scales, which can challenge long-term budgets. It is also less robust for niche or emerging blockchains than other providers.


### 5. Ankr


Ankr is the crowd-pleaser for multi-chain projects, offering decentralized infrastructure at an affordable price. Its extensive network support means you’re not tied to one blockchain, making it perfect for developers exploring cross-chain innovation.


Cons: Performance can be inconsistent due to variability in node quality across the network. Developer documentation could be more detailed to assist with complex setups.


### So, who’s your RPC BFF?


The perfect RPC provider depends on your blockchain playground. Need Ethereum-centric speed? Alchemy and Infura are top picks. Going multi-chain? Ankr might be your jam. But if you’re in the Polkadot or Kusama ecosystems, Dwellir stands out as the ultimate choice for seamless, reliable performance.
