The newest feature on the Apillon platform allows you to enrich your Web3 development process with community feedback, discuss the opportunities for dapp creators, and — most importantly — co-create the future of Web3.


### Why Discord connectivity?


Apillon is a user-oriented Web3 development platform where every feature is built with developers in mind.


Discord connectivity lets you link your Apillon account to Apillon’s Discord server and actively participate in the platform’s evolution through community-oriented governance.


The Apillon Discord server will devote two channels to governance-related topics:


Apillon governance model will roll out in three phases, and initially, only discussion around governance-related topics will be activated. In future versions of the Apillon platform, more features and initiatives will be provided to the Apillon and NCTR token community.

To become a member of the governance channels, you need permission from the team based on your activity as an Apillon user.


#### Phases of Apillon governance


Apillon governance model encourages different communities to partake in the platform’s evolution — primarily Web3 developers, but also NCTR token holders and project ambassadors.


In Phase 1, all connected users with a registered Apillon account will be able to discuss the proposals drafted by the Apillon team. This will allow Apillon to test the governance voting protocols and monitor the open discussions.


In Phase 2, the Apillon governance model will undergo changed dynamics of proposal discussions and user participation. Apillon users that hold and stake NCTR tokens will assume more voting power.


And lastly, in Phase 3, Apillon will roll out upgraded blockchain-based voting mechanics giving more voting power to Apillon users and Web3 developers, and assigning them greater responsibility in co-creating a platform to suit their engineering needs better.
