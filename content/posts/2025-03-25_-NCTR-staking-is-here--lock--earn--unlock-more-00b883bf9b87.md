### The token lock is in. And the yield is real.


We promised. You waited. And now it’s happening:


Starting today, any $NCTR holder can interact with a brand-new smart contract that lets you lock tokens and earn a 20% Annual Percentage Yield — just for holding tight. But this isn’t just about passive gains (though 20% is nothing to sneeze at). This move paves the way for more $NCTR utilities coming soon — ones centered around rewards, governance, and user incentives.


### How does staking actually work?


Head to apillon.io/nctr. If you’ve been around since vesting days, you already know the link — it’s the same one you used to claim unlocked $NCTR. But now it’s been upgraded with a sleek new interface for staking.

Here’s the flow:


The contract lives on the Moonbeam network, so make sure you’ve got GLMR for gas.


Once staked, the dashboard shows your staking tranches, unlock dates, and earned rewards — no guesswork needed.


### What do you get for staking?


Besides a sweet 20% APY? Glad you asked. To earn that full yield, you’ll need to:


This isn’t a parking lot. It’s a launchpad.


Because on top of the APY, staking unlocks access to new $NCTR utilities — with more in the works.


Here’s what locking $NCTR gets you:


Basically, the more skin you put in the game, the more game you get to play. And this is what it will look like:


### Staking now, building what’s next


This is just the first step in a bigger plan for $NCTR utility.


By staking, you’re not only growing your bag — you’re activating your role in the ecosystem. And with rewards, governance, and incentives all designed around locked tokens, the message is clear: long-term holders win big.


So, if you’re holding $NCTR, now’s the time to level up.


### Let’s build. Let’s earn. Let’s go.


Lock your $NCTR and start earning. And if you have any questions, our team’s always a ping away.
