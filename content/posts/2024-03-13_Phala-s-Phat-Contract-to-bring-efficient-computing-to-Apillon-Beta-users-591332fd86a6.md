### Web3 Computing withÂ Phala


Phala Network has changed the computing paradigm in Web3 by introducing the off-chain yet decentralized and trustless computing infrastructure.

[Phala Network](https://phala.network/)

Why does this matter for Web3 developers?


Building on-chain delivers many incredible opportunities but also comes with several technical drawbacks. Too often, only relying on smart contracts fails to sustain rich feature sets in increasingly advanced and multi-functional dapps. Besides, deploying every action on-chain could lead to high costs and delays.


Phala solves this by connecting smart contracts to Phat Contracts. These allow developers to bring their dapps to a whole new level using seamless cross-chain integrations and providing storage for different-chain keys, off-chain infrastructure, and heavy-duty computation power compared to on-chain computing.


With Apillon, Phat Contractâ€™s capabilities will be made available to every user, initially through the platformâ€™s first Phala integration, SchrÃ¶dingerâ€™s NFT.

### Why Phat Contract?


Phat Contracts are computing programs that run off-chain on Phala Network and allow developers to add a wide array of features to their dapps.

[Phat Contracts](/developers/phat-contract)

Phat Contract is not a substitute but a supplement to the typical smart contract, as it power-boosts it with robust off-chain services while respecting the core principles of Web3.


Despite being off-chain, the distributed network and assigned off-chain workers ensure itâ€™s tamper-proof and attest to the fidelity of deployed contracts and their execution.

This allows developers using Phat Contracts to reduce the costs and limitations they would otherwise face using on-chain smart contracts. Still, they can enjoy the trustlessness, verifiability, and permissionlessness that come with on-chain transactions.


#### Phat Contract, even Phat-terÂ Benefits


Compared to a typical smart contract, Phalaâ€™s Phat Contract comes with several advantages. These stem from its combination of on-chain verification and off-chain technical capabilities.


Phat Contract can execute complex off-chain computations in real-time, leading to faster transaction processing and no transaction fees. It also provides greater database support and complies with a wide variety of libraries, sparing developers the need to rely on centralized cloud solutions.


Thanks to its hardware-based encryption, it delivers greater data security and tamper-resistance, topped with low-latency and low-gas fee interactions.


On the Web2 side, Phat Contract supports HTTP/HTTPS requests via smart contract, enabling connectivity to legacy systems via APIs. On the Web3 side, its compatibility with EVM and Substrate blockchains supports easy cross-chain integration, cutting the need for dapps to use a third-party bridge.

All the above features make Phat Contract a powerful option for developers who seek to enhance their back-end computation logic while connecting their smart contract to APIs, interacting with S3 storage platforms, automating smart contracts, and more.


### Apillonâ€™s first Phat integrationâ€Šâ€”â€ŠSchrÃ¶dingerâ€™s NFT


SchrÃ¶dingerâ€™s NFT represents the initial integration of Phalaâ€™s Phat contract on Apillon, where the back-end logic is designed for admins to encrypt files and users to decrypt them using an NFT from a linked NFT collection.


With SchrÃ¶dingerâ€™s NFT, a non-fungible token works as an authorization lock that only unlocks contents when the correct key is used. The encryption/decryption key is generated and used only within the smart contract and never gets exposed externally.

[SchrÃ¶dingerâ€™s NFT Beta live on ApillonAfter the initial demo release, the NFT-based encryption functionality is now available for Apillon Beta users.blog.apillon.io](https://blog.apillon.io/schr%C3%B6dingers-nft-beta-live-on-apillon-73f03d6b61cd)

The computing side of SchrÃ¶dingerâ€™s NFT is fully powered by a Phat Contract that the Apillon team built using ink! via Rust, more specifically, Phalaâ€™s pink extension.

In future platform versions, Apillonâ€™s Phala integration would level up to an upgraded Phat Contract, allowing users to write custom logic and apply it to their specific use case or dapp.
