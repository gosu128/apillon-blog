### By introducing the payment system, Apillon becomes a complete Web3 SaaS platform


#### Officially closing the Apillon Closed Beta version, Apillon is introducing full-stack subscription plans that offer price stability for Web3 builders.


Today, Apillon reaches an important milestone: the first major release of the Apillon Web3 development platform: version 1.0! The introduction of the billing plan also marks the end of the Apillon Closed Beta period.


Stripe implementation will ensure safe fiat-processing transactions, while the platform’s unified pricing principle will open the door to more scalable business options for either established Web2-based players or Web3-newcomer devs and startups.


### Unified pricing: the road to mass adoption


In Web3, most things are paid with tokens, which are volatile—pricing of services, parachains, and sometimes even workforce. And that’s where most emerging businesses either lose assets or faith. Predicting costs on volatile assets is hard, and anticipating the pricing schemes for the growing user base becomes complex or even impossible.


Apillon's stance on pricing in Web3 has always been clear: developers must focus on creating new products rather than dealing with token volatility and complex payment systems.


Apillon’s pricing model resists the market's instability and provides users with stable monthly pricing. This way, they can plan the resources spent on Web3 projects without losing sleep.

### Less money, more building


There are countless ways to build something amazing and unique. So why should there be just one boring, inflexible way to charge for our services?


We’ve conjured up a system that provides the best options and cheapest prices depending on your building needs.


⧓ If you require recurring Web3 functionalities like website hosting and content storing, monthly Subscription plans are the most suitable option for you. They will provide lifetime storage capacity and monthly bandwidth — you can choose among three plans, depending on your desired volume.


⧓ On top of that, when you require one-time execution Web3 services, like NFT collection minting, there are platform credits at your disposal. They work as a pay-as-you-go model, meaning you buy as many credits as you need and as often as you need.


#### Ok, now let’s talk subscription plans…


#### …and credits


As mentioned, credits enable you to use services you won’t need every day, every month, or even more than once.


To better understand all the available functionalities, plus their expenditures and limits, here is a complete price list of the Apillon platform services.
