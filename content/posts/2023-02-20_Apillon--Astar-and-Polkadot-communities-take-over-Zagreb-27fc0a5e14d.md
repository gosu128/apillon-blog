### Apillon, Astar and Polkadot communities take over Zagreb


#### Apillon hosts the first Polkadot Meetup Zagreb with Astar Network, and solidifies the foundation for accelerating the Web3 movement in the area.


The first Polkadot Meetup Zagreb has proven (at least) one thing: there are more Polkadot enthusiasts and blockchain believers in the Central European region than one could have imagined.


Even though the list of key speakers and the agenda Apillon prepared for the event on February 16 at the Swanky Monkey Garden Bar were more than exciting, a huge crowd wasn’t expected. After all, this was the first Polkadot meetup in the city ever.


But then, the eclectic venue began to fill up — and kept filling up until you were suddenly completely surrounded by curious individuals who all came to do the same thing — talk all things Polkadot.

### The agenda was giving from beginning to end


The event opened with a presentation by Urban Osvald, Developers Relations Partnerships Lead at Parity Technologies. Setting the stage for the night, his presentation spanned from the beginnings of blockchain and its first use cases to insights into the current state of the Polkadot Network.

Next one up was Hoon Kim, CTO at Astar Network, who immediately captivated the audience with his energetic presence. Stating his presentation will cater to non-developers with basic blockchain understanding, Kim went on to explain the vision of Astar Network, a scalable blockchain that enables multichain smart contracts.

If the first half of the meetup delivered content for a more general audience, Nino Kutnjak, CPO at Apillon, dedicated more attention to the developers among the crowd. Showcasing Web3 projects you could build with the Apillon Web3 development platform, it was fascinating to see what Web3 services are already easily accessible through simple API calls.

And to finish the magnificent night off in style, Bruno Škvorc, founder of RMRK (pronounced “remark”), dove into the real value of the next-gen, composable, equippable, multi-resource, and multi-chain NFTs, overthrowing some common misconceptions about NFTs.

### The role of local Polkadot meetups for a decentralized future


Co-hosted by Apillon and Astar Network, the first Polkadot Meetup Zagreb is set to pave the way for regular future Polkadot meetups in the Central European region.


A strong Web3 community is essential for the broad adoption of a decentralized future and close-knit communities start at a local level. With full support from other key players of the Polkadot ecosystem, Apillon regularly hosts events to provide space for Web3 enthusiasts.
