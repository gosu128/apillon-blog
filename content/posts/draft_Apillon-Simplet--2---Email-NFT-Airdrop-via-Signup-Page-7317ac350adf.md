Now, let‚Äôs see what the simplet and its mechanics are all about.


### What does this simplet¬†do?


Put simply, the simplet helps your brand to grow your audience and attract new customers through distributing digital gifts.


By giving away unique digital rewards (NFTs), you have a greater chance of incentivizing new subscribers to sign up for your page. You grow your email list, they get a special token from you, a win-win.


### Where does it come in¬†handy?


Imagine your brans is launching a special campaign that aims to grow your user base and generate new leads.


By offering a unique digital gift to everyone who goes to your page and leaves their email, you can build excitement and benefit from your audience‚Äôs FOMO.


You can choose to distribute NFTs based on a first-come-first-serve basis or include a waitlist to build anticipation.


### Why Email NFT Airdrop via Signup¬†Page?


The Email NFT Airdrop via Signup Page simplet allows you to create and release such a community-building campaign without having to dive deep into the Web3 technologies, blockchain infrastructure, or complex setups.

Once you or your in-house developer team is done creating an NFT collection to attract new subscribers, you can have them leave their email on your purposefully crafted landing page. After the emails are collected, the simplet initiates an automatic distribution of NFTs to their rightful owners.


This comes particularly handy if you wish to grow your brand as a future-oriented visionary, but your IT team lacks Web3 knowledge, and you don‚Äôt want to go to great lengths to hire an external team to develop everything from scratch.


### How can you use¬†it?


After setting up your admin panel, your customized simplet can collect the emails your newly onboarded customers left on your webpage.


When you‚Äôre ready to distribute NFTs in exchange for their signup‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbe it at the end of the campaign or right away‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääyou can do so simply by notifying them via email along with the instructions on how to claim their digital rewards.


You can also track the delivery status and follow up with contacts who might got lost in the process.


### How to run this¬†simplet?


Before you or your IT department launches this simplet, there are a few things that need to be put in place, first:

#### But why do you need all these¬†things?


Apillon Simplets were created to pack complex Web3/decentralized solutions in ready-to-use toolboxes covering specific use cases. As such, they rely on several decentralized services provided by the Apillon platform and are required for the simplet to work as intended.


In the case of the Email NFT Airdrop via Signup Page simplet, the decentralized services used are:


#### Implementation


When it comes to deploying the simplet, two parts need to be taken care of: the front end and the back end.


Your brand campaign‚Äôs front end can be run locally on your IT department‚Äôs computer or hosted on any website provider, such as WordPress. Or, you can shoose to host it completely decentrally on a server of choice using Apillon‚Äôs Web3 Hosting service.

The back end, on the other hand, can also be run locally on your in-house computer. Alternatively, you could also a tool called Docker and customize configuration files using your campaign‚Äôs information, including NFT details and email server data.

#### Admin view


When both parts are set up, you can go to your custom admin dashboard and connect your wallet. You should use an Ethereum-compatible wallet, such as MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, or WalletConnect.


The dashboard lists the data of new subscribers who left their email on your campaign‚Äôs landing page, including the NFT distribution time, transaction hash once done, and email sent time.


If you gathered email somewhere else, you can also add new recipients by clicking the ‚ÄúUpload CSV‚Äù button and add the list in the CSV format or do it one-by-one with the ‚ÄúAdd recipient‚Äù button.

Now, you can see the list of your subscribers eligible for NFT rewards on the simplet dashboard.

With all data in one spot, you can easily track your campaign success, follow up with receipients who failed to collect NFT rewards, or add new subscribers to the list.


#### User view


Here is what your audience will see when they get to your lead-generating landing page.


First, a customer leaves their email and hits ‚ÄúSign up‚Äù.


Once they do that, they receive an email with detailed instructions on claiming their NFT reward.


(Or, if they know the process already, they can continue doing so directly on your landing page).


You can track the status of NFT distribution in your admin panel and, if needed, follow up with subscribers who have yet to receive their digital gift.
