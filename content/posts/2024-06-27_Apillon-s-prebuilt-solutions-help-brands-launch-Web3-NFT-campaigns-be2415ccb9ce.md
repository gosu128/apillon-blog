### The bigÂ picture


For years, decentralized technologies have revolutionized the way brands expand their offerings, build customer loyalty, and deliver digitized experiences to their audiences.


However, launching a Web3-based (typically using NFTs) campaign has typically required a project to invest heavy resources and time into its development, testing, and distribution.


Hence, it was predominantly big, household brand names that managed to take advantage of Web3 opportunities and successfully brought NFT-based initiatives to end users.


But Web3 was build to democratize the Internet and level the playing field for everyone. Yet its current technical complexity unfortunately keeps it mostly reserved for the big guys and teams with nerves of steel.


If Web3 is to serve everyone, including brands and companies without massive funds and teams to develop everything from scratch, there must be a better way.


In Web2, the abstraction and simplification of back-end setups have brought about incredibly useful solutions that revolutionized how people approach online business and customer interaction. Think Shopify, which has reduced online store creation to customizable templates and payment integrations, and WordPress, which gave everyone, be it enterprises or individuals, a means to build an online presence and reach new audiences with numerous plugins.


And something similar should be made available for brands looking into Web3 and NFTs, too.


Enter Apillonâ€™s prebuilt solutions.


### Apillonâ€™s Prebuilt Solutions


Prebuilt solutions are one of the most significant features of the Apillon platform and a pinnacle of in-house innovation.


They represent plug-and play, no-code/low-code templates for the five most common use cases of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), customizable to match the brand or project, and with all the technical complexity packed neatly at the back end.


Complementing Apillonâ€™s Web3 Services and Smart Contracts in ease of use, prebuilt solutions can be deployed with minimum modifications required.


Open-source by nature, they also allow brands to add or expand on the provided features so they are not confined to preset possibilities.


#### Who are they meantÂ for?


Apillonâ€™s prebuilt solutions are aimed at businesses, brands, freelancers, or agencies that play with the idea of launching a project or campaign based on decentralized technologies, or more specifically, NFTs, yet lack the experience or resources to do it in a reasonably short time and with a modest budget.


They also serve developers who donâ€™t have the time or knowledge to configure everything manually but want to increase their productivity or boost their service portfolio.


During the deployment process, thereâ€™s no need to deal directly with the blockchain network or acquire tokens. The use of credit card is enough to use the Apillon platform, customize the pre-made front-end templates and deploy a custom solution aligned with a brandâ€™s campaign goalâ€Šâ€”â€Šby tomorrow.


#### What makes them customer-oriented?


Making Web3 technologies useful is not just a question of how brands implement them in their growth initiatives. But, more importantly, how easily and stress-free such solutions are adopted by end consumers.


Apillonâ€™s premade solutions have addressed this issue, too, by lowering the threshold for end consumers to onboard a brandâ€™s Web3/NFT campaign:


#### How do theyÂ work?


Apillonâ€™s prebuilt solutions are open-source docker images that include typical Web2 full-stack open-source solutions, e.g., Node.js, Express.js, SQL DB, front-end Vue.js or any other, and docker configurations.


They can be accessed and adjusted to the projectâ€™s needs, and deployed with a few clicks, without the need to understand or deep-dive into underlying blockchain complexities.


This is how prebuilt solutions show up on the Apillon platform. ðŸ‘‡

They can be installed on AWS or anywhere one prefers, much like a Wordpress.zip file can be installed on any server or cloud of choice. This allows brands to take what they need and integrate it within their established systems.


The same principle applies to data gathering. All the emails or other data collected through such solutions can be isolated, stored and managed in the brandsâ€™ database, allowing them to handle their customersâ€™ data independently, without ever exposing them to Apillon.


Prebuilt solutions work with a brandâ€™s domain, emails and branding, so they can send emails directly from their domain through simple configuration, making them GDPR-compliant.


While the modules are open-source and allow back-end adjustments, they donâ€™t actually require any infrastructural modifications before deployment.


Apillonâ€™s prebuilt solutions have yet to reach production grade so stay tuned for the official release. Besides, once ready, they will likely integrate account abstraction, a.k.a. the embedded wallet solution, to further accelerate the onboarding of new users through brand campaigns.


### Prebuilt solutions portfolio


Currently, the Apillon platform delivers blueprints of five prebuilt solutions, with more to come. At this stage, all of them are NFT-based and respond to the variety of ways unique digital assets can be used in enterprise or brand initiatives.

[Email NFT Airdrop via Signup Page](#959e)
[Proof of Attendance NFTs](#1e01)
[Whitelist NFT Claim](#29b0)
[OpenGov WASM Proposal Airdrop](#3cb8)

The prebuilt solutions can be used to grow a brandâ€™s community, launch loyalty programs, distribute digital collectibles, use proofs of attendance to incentivize and award customers, and more.


Letâ€™s see what they deliver and how you can use them.


#### Email NFTÂ Airdrop


With this solution, you can easily create an NFT collection, upload a list of email addresses, and automatically distribute NFTs to them.


You can add email addresses one by one or in bulk via file upload. When youâ€™re ready to send out NFTs, you can automate email notifications with instructions on how to claim them. And, once NFTs are distributed, you can track (un)successful deliveries and follow up if needed.


This is especially useful for campaigns or events where you award your customer base, say, users who registered on your website.


#### Email NFT Airdrop via SignupÂ Page


Similarly to the solution above, you can distribute a limited or unlimited supply of NFTs to users who signed up to a waitlist using their email addresses.


When youâ€™re ready to distribute, you can automate email instructions on how to claim NFTs. And, once distributed, you can check the delivery status and follow up with wallets that have yet to receive their NFTs.


You can use it in cases like exclusive campaigns that award digital goodies on a first-come-first-serve basis and/or include a waitlist. This helps you build excitement and leverage the customersâ€™ FOMO.


#### PoAPsâ€Šâ€”â€ŠProof of Attendance NFTs


To boost the turnout at live events and reward your audience, you can create campaigns with Proof-of-Attendance NFTs.


At live events, attendees often canâ€™t be bothered or donâ€™t have time to deal with the process of acquiring an NFT reward. But they can choose to mint or reserve them.


The solution comes with a landing page template that hosts a constantly updating QR code and email flow for NFT distribution. Written in React, they are both customizable so you can align them fully with your brandâ€™s look and feel.


At the venue, put up a tablet showing your landing page with a QR code that updates every few secondsâ€Šâ€”â€Šthis guarantees the scans are done by attendees in person. Once scanned, they enter your preset email flow to receive an NFT, growing your customer baseâ€Šâ€”â€Šand contact listâ€Šâ€”â€Šeasily and fast.


#### Whitelist NFTÂ Claim


Allowing only certain users to claim an NFT directly on-chain can be tricky, but not with this pre-build solution.


As an admin, you can easily list the whitelisted wallet addresses that qualify for claiming NFTs, update and change them at any time, and track whether they started the process.


The solutionâ€™s back end integrates off-chain signatures and on-chain verification method, so you donâ€™t have to worry about doing it manually.


This is particularly handy in campaigns like lucky draws or competitions, where only certain users out of many have the privilege of receiving their NFT rewards.


#### OpenGov WASM ProposalÂ Airdrop


If you are no stranger to Web3 and participate in Polkadotâ€™s OpenGov platform, this prebuilt solution can help you distribute NFT rewards to governance participants.


You can send NFTs easily to voters who voted in a certain way on a specific OpenGov Proposal. Simply set the proposalâ€™s ID and the target voting result, collect wallet addresses of all the relevant voters, and distribute NFTs away. You can also track the delivery status and follow up if needed.


The distribution is done via a WASM smart contract, neatly packed in the back end, leaving you with just a few simple steps to reward OpenGov voters.


True to its name, the solution is designed specifically to bring the rewarding feature to the participants in Polkadotâ€™s OpenGov governance platform. Now, you can show your appreciation to voters (on either side) beyond just comments in the discussion thread.


### From theory toÂ practice


The above prebuilt solutions are but a starting point. Much remains to be done in terms of perfecting the back end and delivering production- and market-ready products.


However, they work well enough to serve as a starting point for building customized solutions. As such, Apillon has already developed and launched client-specific projects based on the available templates, including:

### Ready-made Web3


The prebuilt solutions are planned to launch at a production level in a couple of months.


But for now, they clearly demonstrate and embody the mindset of the Apillon team and our determination to bring Web3 to simple terms, technically and semantically.
