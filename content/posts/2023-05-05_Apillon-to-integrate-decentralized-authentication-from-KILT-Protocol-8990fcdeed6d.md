### Apillon to integrate decentralized authentication from KILTÂ Protocol


#### Users will be able to create dapps with wallet-based authentication and equip digital assets withÂ DIDs.


Apillon marks a new important milestone by introducing a next-gen Web3 authentication service, powered by KILT Protocol, to the Apillon platform.

As devs will be able to seamlessly incorporate decentralized digital authentication and verification into their projects, the end-users will be in total ownership of their data without the need to deal with complex technology.


#### What is KILT Protocol?


KILT Protocol is a blockchain identity protocol for generating decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials.

Anything can have an identityâ€Šâ€”â€Špeople, machines, services, and even IoT devices. As credentials are linked to a DID, a digital identity is formed that enables authentication. A DID is at the core of a digital identity and can be added to a digital wallet, meaning the owner of the walletâ€™s private key is in total control of the stored data.

#### In code weÂ trust!


Historically, centralized entities have managed authentication for online services while storing user credentials and monetizing personal data.


KILT Protocol shifts the responsibility of managing user credentials and data from centralized authorities to computer code running in the back end of authentication-based online interaction, restoring control and autonomy to the individual as well as empowering their online interactions.


As credentials are issued, a userâ€™s data is never stored on the KILT blockchain; only a checksum (hash) that represents the information. When a user wants to unlock a service, they can verify their identity or the authenticity of their assets by sharing their credential.


With verified credentials and DIDs, businesses and app creators can provide a wide range of identity solutions. KILT Protocol use cases span NFTs, gaming, media, financial services, supply chain, IoT, and energy. Most recently, KILT Protocol announced exciting partnerships with accounting firm Deloitte Consulting AG, global publisher Axel Springer, and music marketplace Public Pressure.

#### Apillonâ€™s basic Web3 building toolkit soonÂ complete


Besides Web3 Storage and Hosting powered by Crust Network on the Apillon platform and Web3 Computing to be powered by Phala Network, Web3 Authentication is one of the vital Web3 services a developer needs to build a decentralized project from start to finish.

Once KILT Protocol is integrated into Apillon, the final essential Web3 building block on the platform will fall into place.


Apillon users will be able to build an NFT platform, GameFi, DeFi, or any other dapp allowing the end-users to create a DID, store it in their wallet, and log in securely while remaining in total control of their data.


Eventually, the Apillon platform will evolve even further and integrate new Web3 services that will take Web3 projects to new heights. Until then, follow our social media channels to keep track of future partnerships!


You can also try out Web3 Storage and Web3 Hosting on the Apillon platform for free and make your blog or website unstoppable.
