### Paris Blockchain Week: Everybody’s (still) talking about the need for good UX


As one of the main takeaways of many talks on and off the record at this year's PBW was the importance of a good UX overlay in blockchain and crypto, Apillon has strongly positioned itself as exactly what the wider ecosystem needs.

Only a couple of weeks after the Apillon team made a splash at ETHDenver, it was time to spread our wings outside the BUIDL universe at a slightly more biz-oriented (and one might dare say more fashionable) PBW.


At the end of the day, we’re not just building for the builders. Or better said, the builders are not just building for themselves, so it was incredible to get the confirmation that there are plenty of people outside the developer bubble who already recognize the value the Apillon platform brings.

Merci, Paris Blockchain Week, as you have left us richer with inspiration, invaluable connections, and unforgettable French carbs. You know the drill, photo ops, and tweets await below!


#### 1. Tacos on the Rock — event


Can you think of a better way to kick off Paris Blockchain Week than at the ultimate Web3 taco party?


As March 20 marked the first day of PBW2023, many Web3 enthusiasts closed the night off in style as they joined the Apillon team for a fun night at Candelaria in the company of Parity Technologies, Ternoa, Acurast, RMRK, and Logion Network.

#### 2. dotSocial — panel discussion and event


The main course of Paris Blockchain Week for the Apillon team was at dotSocial. Besides acting as one of the judges for the finalists of Polkadot’s AngelHack, our co-founder and CEO Matjaž Sobočan participated in a panel on why we need UX-centered design for wider Web3 adoption.

UX was truly THE hot topic at this year’s PBW. If you want to dive in and better understand why Web3 desperately needs a good UX framework, you can read this great article that our CPO Nino Kutnjak wrote a while back.

Short but sweet, our stay in Paris was fantastique. Follow our social media channels below to not miss the next opportunity to join us, and in the meantime, we suggest you dip your toes into the Web3 waters with the Apillon platform.


You’ll see, Web3 doesn’t have to be scary — even if you’re not a developer. ;)
