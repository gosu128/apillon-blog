### Ready, set, go — Apillon Ambassador program in full swing!


#### Excited by the tremendous response of Apillon’s community applying for ambassadors, we have designed a system that will benefit the most hardworking supporters.


Apillon is on a mission to accelerate the adoption of Web3 and blockchain technology. We are proud to have you on board to help us spread the word, distribute the great news and gain new followers — be it about the Apillon platform, the Polkadot network, or even more general Web3-related content.


You could not have picked a better time because we are on a roll! Kudos to all of you who applied and patiently await further guidelines and directions. And here they are, carefully planned out to cover as much ground and as many applications as possible.


### So, what’s the general feel?


The participants of the Apillon Ambassador program will gradually progress from tier to tier — they will be evaluated according to the quality of their output, the frequency of cooperation and the time passed.


Each tier consists of tasks and assignments that are worth specific amounts of experience points. With time passing and points collected, participants will move through different tiers and assume different roles that suit them best.


All Apillon Ambassador program tiers:


More operational tiers:


— — — — — — —


More structure-based and strategic tiers:


Apillon will track the contributions of the participants of the first two tiers (Candidates and Apprentices) on the Crew3 platform — it is one of the most easy-to-use dashboards where you can track your own progress, pick your favorite tasks and complete them, and compete for the leaderboard’s top spots. You will be amazed at how handy it is!


Progressing onto further tiers (Ambassador, Senior Ambassador, and Evangelist), each contributor’s path will be much more personalized. The Apillon team will provide you with first-hand guidance and general directions, but you yourself will pick out three (3) main verticals to work on and you’ll get the chance to provide a more strategic contribution content-wise and gradually start to manage smaller groups of Apillon Apprentices and other.


Feel confused? Don’t be, it’s really simple! Read on to catch the fine-tuning of it all.


### You’ve applied; now what?


The first steps after applying:


And now, let’s take a closer look at what your Ambassador life will look like in real life, from your humble start to great success.


After applying to the Apillon Ambassador program, your journey will automatically begin as an Apillon Candidate once you’re signed up for the Crew3 platform. After the first 30-day “sprint” on the Crew3, where you’ll perform as many given tasks as possible, Apillon will review the general leaderboard — the most engaged participants will proceed to the next tier and become Apillon Apprentices. If you don’t make it to the top of the leaderboard, you can surely try again and try harder in the next 30-day sprint.


A similar cycle but with more in-depth tasks will repeat for the promoted Apprentices. Once again, the most hardworking contributors will be promoted to the official Ambassador roles — Apillon Ambassadors, Apillon Senior Ambassadors, and Apillon Evangelist Ambassadors.


And this is where the real excitement begins!


At this point, you’ll be given more responsibility and slightly more free rein — you will pick up to three (3) preferred areas/roles so you can excel at your performance. Each area will offer tasks to keep gaining experience points and progress upward.


The array of areas or roles to pick from:


### Is there more?


Yes. However, we don’t want to overwhelm you with all the information that’s not relevant to the process right now so we will leave a more detailed description of the top-tier Ambassador positions for next time, including tasks, responsibilities and rewards. We’ll get to that, that’s a promise.


But for now, let’s all just enjoy the process, dive into the Web3 sphere and raise awareness by spreading the word as best as we know how. We appreciate your trust and enthusiasm, let’s rock this boat, y’all!


### Haven’t applied yet but would like to join in?
