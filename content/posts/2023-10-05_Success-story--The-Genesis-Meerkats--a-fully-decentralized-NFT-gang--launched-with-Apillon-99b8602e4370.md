### The bigger picture


The Genesis Meerkats is a collection of 100 furry heroes deployed as NFTs on Moonbeam and hosted decentrally through the Apillon platform.

They are the same species but so different at the time, each with a distinct personality, power, and strengths. Midjourney AI took over the task of breeding family members through unique digital art and delivered.

While minting has ended already, with all furry heroes sold out within ten days, you can now find them on the Moonbeans marketplace — browse their non-fungible family album and purchase the one that squeaks to you the most.

### Problem: Fast-deployed and independent NFTs


The Genesis Meerkats collection is a brainchild of Bram Willemse, a senior Apillon ambassador who enjoys a good UX and has done an incredible job spreading the word about Web3.

When Bram got the idea of launching an NFT collection, he was determined to bring it to life before you can say decentralization. And do so with fully Web3 DNA, where ownership and access are independent of intermediary platforms. He did it with Apillon.


### Solution: Apillon’s fully decentralized NFTs


The Genesis Meerkats NFT collection was built through Apillon’s click-to-build approach, completely bypassing manual code writing. Besides, the end-to-end decentralized nature of the assets helps Bram retain his ownership and management rights, free from middleman impact.


#### NFTs with Apillon, step-by-step


Despite his knowledge of Web3, Bram didn’t need to dive into the intricacies of the code and launched his NFT collection on the Moonbeam network in a matter of hours.


Here is how he did it.

In a nutshell, Bram used every currently available Apillon service and left no crumbs.


The only thing the furry NFT collection needed left was a marketplace to call home — and it found it on MoonBeans.

#### Apillon pulling strings in the back


A quick inspection into the code that powers the furry non-fungible mob reveals the role of Apillon services.


If you check the project’s smart contract on Moonscan and navigate to the Contract tab, you can see it’s based on the ApillonNFT contract.

[smart contract](https://moonbeam.moonscan.io/address/0x7074c46c6cb4c54f5c549cb949cd59b371518d9e)
[Moonscan](https://moonbeam.moonscan.io/address/0x7074c46c6cb4c54f5c549cb949cd59b371518d9e)

Now, click Read contract and scroll down to 22. tokenURI. Here, in the field under tokenId (uint256), input a value representing a meerkat’s URI, for example, 1, and click Query. The tokenURI method response you get under string shows a link to a .json file holding the NFT’s metadata.


Copy and paste the link into a new browser tab, and see the detailed metadata of that particular NFT hosted on IPFS.


If you input “2” instead of “1” under tokenId, you get a URL string leading to a different NFT’s metadata hosted on IPFS, and so on for every Meerkat.


The decentralized hosting of the project’s website and NFT metadata on IPFS via Crust and Apillon ensures the NFT Meerkats will live on permanently, giving their owners complete ownership rights, bypassing the marketplaces, and mitigating the risk of loss.


### Build an NFT collection in a day


Much like the Meerkats saw the light of Web3 day with just a few clicks, your NFT-based project, game, or loyalty program can, too.


Go to the Apillon dashboard, navigate to NFTs in the menu on the left, and click “Start creating NFTs”.


From there, it’s a walk in the park. Just prepare your unique artwork or assets, their metadata, and click through. Or, if you know your way around code and prefer it more customized, adjust the configuration to your project’s preference via GitHub.


You can opt for either Moonbeam or Astar as the parent network, the process is the same on both.
