### Back up your website with decentralized hosting


#### Subtitle


An website or online platform is only good when accessible without interruptions, censorship or other third-party impact.


To ensure its longevity and unconditional access, as well as prevent losing the old data due to whatever reason, frequent and thorough back-ups are a norm.


It‚Äôs advisable that you integrate different types of website/app backups. Web3 being just one of them, ensuring permanent accessibility and making your website/app unstoppable from third-party intervention. With Apillon, it can be achieved in clicks.

### Why website¬†back-up?


Why you need automated website backup?


Your website should be up and running at all times, no matter what. A solid backup and restore service is vital to your website and business if you want to guarantee uptime for your followers and customers. But what elements need backing up?


These include plugins, customized code, databases, scripts, and much more. All your media, photos, videos, or other content you have created and might have stored for safekeeping carries value.

### Why website backup on¬†Web3?


#### Website on Web3 without using a traditional host¬†provider


It is possible to have a website on Web3 without using a traditional host provider. Web3 is a decentralized network, and websites on Web3 are typically hosted on peer-to-peer networks or blockchain networks.


One way to do this is by using decentralized storage and hosting solutions such as IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) or Swarm. These technologies allow for the storing and hosting and distribution of website files across a peer-to-peer network, rather than relying on a centralized server. With Apillon, you can store your website contents on IPFS (and make it mutable with IPNS) in a few clicks and host it on a decentralized network equally easy.


You can create a website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and then upload the files that compose it to IPFS. Once the files are uploaded, you can access the website through a unique IPFS address.


### The process‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa few-click website backup on¬†Web3


At the time being, hosting a website on Web3 without a traditional web host provider can be more complex and require more technical expertise. It may also come with limitations such as slower load times or limited storage space.


Therefore, it is important to consider the specific needs of your website and the level of technical expertise you have before deciding to host your website on Web3.


If you don‚Äôt have any technical expertise but would still like to create a Web3 Storage and Hosting backup for your website, you can do so with Apillon.


Go to app.apillon.io/storage/‚Ä¶, and click [xyz] or follow [this guide].


Once your website content is uploaded to Web3 storage, a URL is generated leading to your IPFS-based website files. You can add it to your current website using a button for everyone to use, for example ‚ÄúRead Web3 version‚Äù or ‚ÄúContent permanently inscribed on blockchain‚Äù. Or, you can omit it from public sites altogether and just keep the Web3 version for your own record and redirect in case the original website goes down for whatever reason.


The contents will live on even if the original website goes down. And will remain accessible even if Apillon ceases operating.

Once you link your wallet to the Web3 Storage and Web3 Hosting service, the uploaded contents via Apillon get automatically inscribed as permanent pieces of information on a blockchain and thus permanently accessible.


In case your website or its contents become unaccessible or, even worse, censored, in your region, you could still resort to visiting the linked wallet address, click on the hashes and access the content again.


The IPFS backups is an indelible proof that your website contents are really linked to it and can live on despite censorship.

#### What about automatic backups?


Q: Is there a way to ensure automatic backup for websites stored and hosted with apillon? or should contents be uploaded manually with every update? So that the moment a new file or content is integrated in the website, it would automatically be hosted/stored on web3 with Apillon?


#### What are the costs and duration of Web3-stored files?


A number of decentralized storage solutions appeared, including Filecoin, Storj, and Siac. They are great innovations in offering storage on a decentralized network, but they offer storage at a subscription prices. So they are decentralized but would they solve the problem of permanence? apillon also charges subscription fees and deletes the storage buckets after 6 months?


To solve the problem of long-term data storage, the Arweave team innovated upon existing blockchain technology to create permanent storage at an affordable cost. It‚Äôs the first data storage of any kind to offer permanent storage. It offers storage on its immutable and decentralized network for a minimum of 200 years but probably much longer.


Arweave offers two things that are unlike anything else on the internet today:


‚Äî‚Ää-


Arweave: has partnered with Solana to provide a decentralized permanent data storage solution of ledger data, ensuring the data can be always retrieved as required.


Arweave is a new type of storage that backs data with sustainable and perpetual endowments, allowing users and developers to truly store data forever‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääfor the very first time.


As a colectively owned hard drive that never forgets, Arweave allows us to indefinitely preserve crucial information and records, preventing any possible rewriting of history.


The best way to store data permanently is through blockchain technology.


According to some estimates, as much as one-third of all the information on the internet disappears within two years of it being put up. After 20 years, the majority of it has been lost.


This phenomenon is known as link rot, and it confounds our efforts to find reliable information online. Link rot occurs when links to a web page becomes outdated or broken. When this happens, you might end up on a page that no longer exists, or one that has been replaced with something else entirely.


While link rot is a natural part of the web, it can be accelerated by things like changing terms of service, high-profile data loss incidents, and the way that social media platforms are designed (Facebook, Instragram, Twitter, have underwent redesigns that result in links to old content becoming broken, and in some cases, entire pages or accounts may be deleted, taking years of information with them). Similarly, storage companies like Dropbox and Google are difficult to depend on for permanent storage because they regularly change their terms of service and often charge user subscription fees. What happens to your data if you miss a payment? Or if they delete inactive accounts? There are countless ways you can lose access to centrally stored data.


avtomatsko: prek apija, lahko user nastima da mu api avtomatsko updata contente na ipfs


zakaj avtomatsko ne flipne


ti das uniswap org., ki kaze na aws streznik,kjer zivi core app. kaj ce aws pade, kaj ce je regulacija issue, in pade dol? oni istocasno enako verzijo websita nalozijo na ipfs, dobijo ipfs link z dolgimi crevi. to njim ne preprecuje, da bi nardili backup domeno, ki kaze na ta ipfs link. ena zivi na aws, druga na ipfs. to je mozno.


najlazje je znotraj eko reach-outat in dajte si zbackupirat site. edino kar moras poskrbet je da ljudem poves, da majo alternativno pot na ipfs, da so userji aware da obstaja.


kaj mi pocnemo? da vsak da na inps, mi pa drzimo tabelo linkov ipfs, na githubu lahko vidjo tabelo. samo na nasem gitu je vidna tabela, mi jo lahko vzamemo in damo na ipfs in se zacne obnasat kot api, poklicem in recem zlistaj mi vse strani, ki so included na tabeli


ta tabela lahko sluzi kot dns, da imajo ljudje dostop do te tabele.


avtomatski refresh je mozen prek apija ali pa uporabis github actions to set up automatic deployment, oni moraje at svoje apillon api keys pa api secrete, forkajo k sebi repo, daj not podatke in dajo public. recmo da drzijo na gitu, ko deployayo novo verzijo na git, ponavadi je not vkljucen CI, ta stvar zagrabi site in ga pusne na aws, lahko pa pusne tudi k nam. nikoli ne rabi nic nardit. enkrat jo naconfiguriras, normalno deploys na github in normalno updata vse na ipfs.


unstoppable namesto backup?


tut ce mas monorepo (Vse v enem repu na githubu) ali loceno, ne bomo delal distinkcije, ker je vse nekak povezano


ni vazno kake so statisticne sanse da gre dol in rabis backup. mi si s tem postavljamo sistem, kjer o tem sploh ni treba razmisljat


vzame ti 3 min in cost 0 $, zakaj ne bi tega naredil


razlog je tudi marketinski, tudi tehnicni, ker si unstoppable


make your website/web ap unstoppable


continues automatic backup


what does unstoppable bring to the table


odporen si ce steznik pade


odporen si na reg/legal censorship


make it all-time accessible no matter what


you start doing what you preach (mi bomo na aws ker je izi, vi userji bodite pa na web3 in se zajebavajte z walleti), da rata public pressure, kao kdo the f* si ti da nimas tega approved? public initiative, uniswap je prvi ki je sel practicat kar preacha


ce na novo uploadam file, dobim novi link ipfs


ko gre na ipfs, das publish na ipns, ta se lahko switcha glede na to kaj je not, link ostane enak, content se switcha, link ostane crevo v vsakem primeru. lahko pa gres do tadeja, nardis unstoppable campaign.io, on pokaze gor na ipfs link.


izberes ipns name pa ipns description, das publish to ipns. pocakas da se sprocesira. dobis ipns link. ipns link odpres da dobis ipfs/ipns link in s tem gres sharat.


kaj se zgodi v back-endu ko damo na ipns v priemrjavi z ipfs? ce v tem tvojem filus premenim eno crko, se not avtomastcko spremeni hash. ipns pa kaze na tocen folder, ti pa das not kar ces in on ima samo relationship s folderjem, ne filom. ce mas vec filov v folderju, se doda /dfdfgdg na link.


wetransfer prek apillona. nardis bucket, nalozis file. kliknes link in mu ga das. cez 6m bo file nehal obstajat.
