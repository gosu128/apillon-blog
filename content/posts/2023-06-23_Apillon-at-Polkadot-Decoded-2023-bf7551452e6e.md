### Apillon at Polkadot Decoded 2023


#### Two days of Web3 community networking, exploring the ecosystem field and showcasing recent success and future plans — let’s go!


For Apillon, this is going to be a second Polkadot Decoded appearance and — hopefully — even more fulfilling than the first one. It is becoming our little tradition of wildly working on something visionary and full-bodied during the whole year and then presenting the news to the largest multichain ecosystem in Web3.


Well, this year, we’ve already spilled the beans beforehand — Apillon’s Polkadot Treasury Proposal is out! So meet us in Copenhagen to debate and discuss said beans. We are looking forward to any kind of feedback, notes or suggestions as we want to add as much value as we can to all the parties, tangent in the Proposal, especially the Polkadot ecosystem and the wider Web3 sphere.

### One event, two events, five events


The Web3 community will have the opportunity to mingle and listen to the loudest and clearest voices of the Polkadot ecosystem. Apillon will also be participating in the following events if you are interested in what we have to offer to the grand scheme of Web3 things:


#### 1. Polkadot Decoded — Opening night (June 27, 7 PM)

Building the decentralized future should be easy peasy lemon squeezy, not stressed depressed lemon zest. Matjaž Sobočan, CEO at Apillon, will be presenting the Apillon platform and its superpower: to take over the most difficult parachain-based and protocol-level tasks for devs and turns them into APIs or drag-and-drop services to ease the pain of Web3 building.

Matjaž will also talk about the new initiative in town — Web3Approved, a joint effort by Crust Network and Apillon, aimed to promote the decentralization of operations within the Web3 ecosystem — decentralized hosting being a crucial first step on the journey to the wider Web3 adoption. First 100 members get free website hosting for 100 years. Read more about it here or in the blog post below.

#### 3. Apillon demo: Schrödinger’s NFT (June 29, 1–6 PM: Showcase Station booth)


Welcome to join the Showcase Station and explore the latest news. Apillon will display a brand new concept, Schrödinger’s NFT, brewing in close cooperation with Phala Network. Come by and check if your curiosity can kill a cat.


Seeing how there will be a big-screen TV, lots of cool merch and the Apillon team, you don’t want to miss the demo of the new service-to-be. We’ll be at the Showcase Station between 1 PM and 6 PM, ready to answer questions and get a compliment or two.


### Polkadot Decoded or, should we say, Polkadot Low-coded?


Apillon is giving its all to progress the current state of the Polkadot dev-user-experience to a higher level. Building a low-code solution for old-school developers to exponentially boost their onboarding to Web3 technologies is a mission we strive to follow.


In case you are not joining the live conference, there will be some on-line meetings with the Apillon team available for you — check in the event app and book your slot with us.


Nevertheless, in any form, online or offline — we would really appreciate your support with Apillon becoming an open-source infrastructure solution. So come say hello to the Apillon team in Copenhagen or join the discussion on Polkassembly and Polkadot Forum. For the community, for the developers. And for the decentralized future.
