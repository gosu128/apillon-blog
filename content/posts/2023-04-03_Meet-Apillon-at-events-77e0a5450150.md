### Meet Apillon at events


#### Keep track of where we’ve been and where we’re going on our journey to boost Web3 adoption — we might be right around your corner!


As much as we love building in our cozy development cave, we don’t mind getting out there once in a while to empower developers in person to build on the Polkadot blockchain.

Besides organizing an awesome boat party together with KILT Protocol, Authtrail solidified its position in the ecosystem at workshops, conferences, women’s brunches, techno parties… you name it!
