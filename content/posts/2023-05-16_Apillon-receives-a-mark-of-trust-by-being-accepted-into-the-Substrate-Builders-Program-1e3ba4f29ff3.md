### Apillon receives a mark of trust by being accepted into the Substrate Builders Program


#### Parity Technologies’ program welcomes the Web3 development platform to boost growth with extensive resources and dedicated support.


After months of building and polishing the low-code Web3 development platform, Apillon has successfully completed Milestone 1 to officially become a member of the Substrate Builders Program. We are thrilled to have our project recognized as a valuable asset to the Polkadot community by Parity Technologies, the leading organization behind Polkadot and the Substrate blockchain development framework.

Apillon is already working hard toward achieving Milestone 2 of the Program. It’s beyond exciting to progress to new heights on the journey of making Web3 building easier and faster for developers under the watch and lead of Parity Technologies.


#### Feedback, support, and growth for visionary minds


Happy to be in great company — Parity’s prestigious initiative supports the most promising Substrate-based projects. How? With regular hands-on assistance in technical challenges, strategy, and ecosystem building, alongside providing them with best practice examples.


The Parity Technologies-led program helps boost projects, blockchains, applications, and Web3 teams in the Substrate ecosystem by connecting them with the ecosystem’s vast pool of resources. The participants are classified into three tracks: Chains, Infrastructure, and Applications. The latter supports the teams building projects on top of Substrate-based chains, including Apillon.


To build the best tool for Web3 builders, we’re looking forward to making the most of all the possibilities the program has to offer: hands-on technical support and invaluable best practices, feedback with regular check-ins with the program’s tech support lead, guidance and support for community announcements, event organization, exclusive network opportunities, individual feedback, connecting with other Web3 teams in the program, and more.


#### Milestone 1, done and done


For the last couple of months, the Apillon team has been hard at work both inside and outside of our development cave. Here are just some of the achievements that got us to the benchmark: Milestone 1 completed.


In late January, the Closed Beta version of the Apillon platform was released. This invite-only version brought to life the initial drag-and-drop Web3 services on a sleek dashboard UI, allowing developers to build their first Web3 project on the platform.

The Beta release was a direct result of integrating Crust Network-based serverless storing and hosting services into the Apillon platform. The integration included IPFS and storage buckets that offer a novel way of dynamically managing decentralized storage.

Digital wallet login was made available to the platform users via Polkadot wallets, including polkadot.js, SubWallet, and Talisman wallets. This enables a safe login with just a click directly from the browser, allowing users to maintain control over their private keys while they bypass the username and password authentication.

More recently, a fully-fledged NFT service powered by Moonbeam Network was integrated into the Apillon platform to bring the first use case of Moonbeam’s smart contracts: easy and fast creation, minting, and deploying of NFT collections.
