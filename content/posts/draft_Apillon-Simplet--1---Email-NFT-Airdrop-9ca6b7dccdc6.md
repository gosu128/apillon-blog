Ok, let’s dive into the concept of the Email NFT Airdrop simplet and its mechanics.


### What does this simplet do?


Short answer? It helps your brand stand out by awarding your customers a unique digital gift.


The long one? It allows you to increase your customer base’s loyalty by distributing digital rewards in the form of unique tokens, images, audio tracks, and more, simply to their email addresses.


### Where does it come in handy?


Imagine your brand is launching a special promo campaign or reaching an important milestone, and you want to reward your loyal customers for their support.


And what better way than delivering something special, something unique, to mark the occasion? Like NFTs or non-fungible digital tokens.


This kind of digital campaign also elevates your brand to a future-oriented level and showcases your commitment to innovation. A win-win!


### Why the Email NFT Airdrop Simplet?


With the Email NFT Airdrop simplet, you can launch such a campaign fast and without having to understand or navigate the complex blockchain-based back end.


You or your in-house developer can simply create a collection of NFTs of any format in a few clicks, upload the list of email addresses your brand collected, and initiate the automatic distribution of NFTs to listed contacts.


This is especially important for brands that lack the resources to hire a Web3 engineer to build everything from the first to the last line of code.


### How can you use it?


Once your admin panel is live on the Apillon dashboard, you can add your customers’ email addresses one by one or in bulk via CSV file upload.


When your NFTs are ready to be dispatched to your customers, you can automate email notifications with instructions on how they can claim their digital gifts. These lead to a page customized to your brand’s visual identity, seamlessly continuing the gift-claiming flow.


Finally, you can track the delivery status and follow up with customers who might have missed their email or NFT.


### How to run this simplet?

#### But why do you need all these things?


Apillon Simplets are designed as complete packages of Web3/decentralized solutions. As such, they rely on several decentralized services that Apillon provides and that need to be implemented for the simplet to work as intended.


In the case of the Email NFT Airdrop simplet, these are the following:


#### Implementation


There are two parts to deploying a simplet: the front end and the back end.


The front end can be run on your computer or hosted on any website provider, such as WordPress. Alternatively, you can host it on your server of choice in a completely decentralized way using Apillon’s Web3 Hosting service.

As for the back end, you can run it locally on your computer or, if you or your brand’s IT administrator prefers, use a tool called Docker and customize configuration files with your campaign’s information, like NFT details and email server data.

#### Admin view


When both parts are set up, you can go to your custom admin dashboard and connect your wallet. Only Ethereum-compatible wallets are supported, namely MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, or WalletConnect.

Once you’re connected, you can upload the list of your customers’ emails in CSV format. Click “Upload CSV” and, in the pop-up, click “Select CSV file”.

Now, the list of emails intended for the NFT airdrop appears on your admin dashboard.


There, you can also see the airdrop start time, the wallet linked to each email address, the distribution status, and the time the email was/will be sent.


The Email NFT Airdrop simplet interface is designed to easily monitor your campaign’s success and, if needed, expand it by adding new recipients in a few clicks.
