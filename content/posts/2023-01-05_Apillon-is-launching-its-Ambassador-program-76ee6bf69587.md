### Apillon is launching its Ambassador program


#### Apillon welcomes new ambassadors to join the movement of accelerating Web3 adoption. Let’s join forces in building a decentralized world!


Communities are the heart and soul of every blockchain-based project. And what a fantastic one Apillon has! We want to show appreciation to our beloved Apillon community for having our back and invite you to become an extended part of Apillon’s team. How? By joining Apillon’s Ambassador program.


### Apillon wants you


Whether developers or non-technical enthusiasts, every member of the Apillon community is invited to become more involved with Apillon’s path. We are on the lookout for passionate and devoted Web3 believers to support Apillon’s mission — accelerating Web3 adoption by continuously empowering its builders.


Do you believe Apillon is the cornerstone for cooperation and parachain synergy in the Web3 sphere? Then you are the right person to help us spread the word about Apillon’s endeavors and share the vast knowledge with the broader Apillon and Polkadot community.


### You have a lot to gain


At Apillon, we believe hard work pays off.


An active role within a vibrant blockchain community will provide you with hands-on experience and new skills, not to mention the sneak peeks of the vital work we do before we share it with others. You will get to expand your knowledge within Apillon’s private ambassador groups and exclusive events while earning extra rewards such as NCTR tokens, in-person meets with the team, and branded merchandise.


As our Ambassador program evolves, you can expect additional rewards for most valuable community members.


### How does it work?


After submitting your application, you’ll receive a return email with all the necessary guidelines. In the next step, Apillon’s community manager will set up a short call with you to see if we’re the right match.


If you get a spot in Apillon’s Ambassador program, you’ll become an Apprentice for 30 days with granted access to Apillon’s special contents and materials. The area of your activities will be defined based on the type of activities that suit you the most within the areas of community building, content creation, and others.


Depending on your demonstrated level of commitment and activity, you’ll become an Ambassador based on a vote that will take place among our Senior Ambassadors and Head Evangelists.


As Apillon’s Ambassador, you’ll be entrusted with more additional tasks, for which you will regularly receive rewards. Hard work and dedication will lead you to the role of a Senior Ambassador where you’ll be coordinating a group of Ambassadors independently.


And finally, based on the added value you’ll consistently bring to the table over an extended period of time, you’ll be promoted to Head Evangelist to coordinate a group of Senior Ambassadors, run monthly calls, and take on other important responsibilities.
