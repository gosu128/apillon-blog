### Apillon Referendum #161 Thank-You NFTs


#### Passing with flying colors, the Apillon Proposal will soon start to shape up in the realÂ world.


Thanks to you, dear Apillon community and Web3 believers, the Proposal #161 on Polkassembly has passed. ðŸŽ‰

[Proposal #161 on Polkassembly has passed](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referenda/161)

A very special thanks goes not only to those who voted AYE but also to those who stood by us, provided us with support, and shared their knowledge.


We would like to express our gratitude to all of you who shared your public support for Apillon over these past few weeks. We gathered the majority in the blog below. A big THANK YOU to those not included in the post; you know who you are! ðŸ«¶

To timestamp this vital step, we are airdropping an exclusive limited-edition NFT collectionâ€Šâ€”â€ŠApillon Referendum #161 Thank-You NFTs.


The purpose of this collection is simpleâ€Šâ€”â€Što show the Apillon teamâ€™s gratitude to all AYE voters who helped bring Proposal #161 to the green majority.


### How to get yourÂ NFT?


If you voted AYE on the Proposal, thereâ€™s nothing you need to do and no costs are involved in the process.


The Apillon team gathered the addresses that submitted their AYE vote, those that voted directly, as well as others that delegated their vote, and airdropped pre-minted NFTs to those addresses.


The airdrop was executed directly to Astar addresses, converted from Substrate accounts used by the users to vote. So, all users who wish to see their NFT, need to switch to Astar Network in their favorite wallet.


Besides directly airdropping NFTs to the accounts voting on the Apillon Proposal, we have been working with the Paras team to extend community support and back the Apillon Gratitude NFT collection. Hereâ€™s how to access it:

### Future utility


All NFTs are custom-designed and include all relevant metadata. For example, the surprise parameter is added to unlock the future utility of the NFT.


This feature will be released soon, so keep following our social channels to learn more about the surprise and utility you will be able to unlock.


### Final thoughts


The launch of the Apillon Gratitude NFT Collection has a couple of benefits.


First, itâ€™s our way of saying thank you to everyone who contributed to the passing of the Apillon Proposalâ€Šâ€”â€Šwe couldnâ€™t have done it without your support.


And second, it showcases an important feature and UI upgrade to be released soon after the NFT airdrop. It will allow anyone to execute NFT airdrops and replicate the campaign, or simply transfer multiple NFTs to multiple addresses with a few clicks.


Let us know how you like your Apillon NFT and start building your own NFT collection.
