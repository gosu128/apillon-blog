### Apillon team rocked the stages in London and Brno


#### While presenting Apillon at conferences, we‘re building momentum before the much-anticipated platform launch in Q1 2023.


While in London for the Token2049 conference that brought together professionals from the financial and strategic scopes of Web3, Apillon took the central role on stage at a special Polkadot event, hosted by Parity Technologies.

One day after a special Beyond the Chain event, Apillon made some waves in the Czech Web3 community. Matjaž, Apillon’s CEO, was talking at DOTBrno — a community-oriented and Polkadot-centered get-together.

Domen Uršič, co-founder and CMO at Apillon, gave a speech about Apillon’s contribution to Web3 adoption through its development platform. Later on, he participated as a panel guest at a round table to discuss the future of all things Web3 alongside Phala Network, Composable Finance, and Cumulus Encrypted Storage System (CESS). There were more than 100 blockchain professionals attending the event, engaging in discussion, and mingling with other top-tier entrepreneurs in the field.

### Connecting with communities at DOTBrno


Brno offers an interesting blend of people — talent density provided by the University of Technology plus the numerous tech companies offering a great deal of potential for inventions and innovations.


Organized by joint forces of Apillon, Koda.dot, and Polkadotters, DOTBrno brought together Web3 natives, IT students, and crypto enthusiasts from Prague, Vienna, Munich, Berlin, Bratislava, and Ljubljana. The day was well spent discussing the Polkadot ecosystem and its role in the wider Web3 adoption movement.

Events in London and Brno were both superb — another proof that Apillon is on track to becoming a go-to tool for Web3 builders, boosting the Polkadot adoption as it accelerates the world‘s transition to a decentralized future.


We will continue to spread the word about Apillon at conferences and events, starting on November 23rd at The blockchain festival of Europe in Berlin, one of the biggest Web3 events in Europe, and following up at Sub0 — the Polkadot developer conference in Lisbon on November 27/28.
