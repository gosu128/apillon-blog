### Say Hello to Celo: Apillon Platform is now Celo’s Launch Day Support Partner


#### We’re thrilled to announce that Apillon is an official Celo’s Day-0 Launch partner! This marks a new era of seamless blockchain development, as Celo’s ultra-efficient, mobile-first blockchain is now fully integrated into the Apillon platform.


Web3 is evolving fast, and with it, the need for builders to go beyond speculation and deliver real, impactful solutions. One-size-fits-all approaches don’t cut it anymore — developers need customized chains tailored to their specific needs.


At Apillon, we’re committed to making Web3 development seamless. That’s why we keep expanding our platform with smarter tools, improved options, and frictionless workflows, helping developers focus on what truly matters — building, scaling, and innovating.


With this integration, builders can leverage Celo’s fast, eco-friendly infrastructure directly through Apillon’s no-code and API-powered development suite — making Web3 more accessible than ever.


### What is Celo?


Celo is a mobile-first, proof-of-stake blockchain platform designed to facilitate accessible and inclusive financial services worldwide. By enabling users to send cryptocurrency using mobile phone numbers, Celo simplifies digital payments, aiming to support the nearly 2 billion unbanked individuals globally.

### Why Apillon x Celo?


Multi-chain isn’t just a trend — it’s the backbone of Web3’s evolution. At Apillon, we’re building a future where developers don’t have to choose between chains. Seamless interoperability, maximum flexibility — have it all.


By integrating Celo, Apillon not only diversifies its multi-chain gateway — originally built on linked Polkadot parachains — but also brings a blockchain designed for real-world usability into the fold, empowering developers to build accessible, cost-effective dApps regardless of their technical background.


### The Future is Multichain


Apillon’s multi-chain approach empowers developers by offering a diverse selection of blockchain tools, enabling them to build solutions that align perfectly with their project needs and core values.


By supporting multiple chains, Apillon provides the flexibility to tap into the unique strengths of different ecosystems — enhancing performance, security, and scalability — so developers can innovate freely and seamlessly transition their ideas into the real economy.


Here’s how we simplify the process:
