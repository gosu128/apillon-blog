### Web3 gaming starts where Web2 gamingÂ ends


#### Web3 games are writing the next chapter of gaming, but what are the main differences between Web2 gaming and Web3Â gaming?


The gaming experience has come a long way since its early days. Graphics are more realistic, resolutions are higher, games run more smoothly thanks to more powerful processing powers, and thereâ€™s always something new to try, whether itâ€™s a new VR set or playing in open worlds where you can interact with other players.


While the gaming experience has been undeniably and steadily improving, some principles that make the gaming world go around remain the same.


That is until Web3 games came along. But what sets Web3 gaming apart from Web2 gaming?


### What is Web2 gaming, and why does it need to up itsÂ game?


For the past two decades, Web2 gaming was the only gaming model we knew.


Web2 gaming refers to the traditional online gaming experiences that are built upon Web2 technologies using a centralized approach to both game development and monetization.


Web2 games exist on centralized gaming servers that store all the in-game information in one spot. The main characteristics of Web2 gaming are centralized platforms, closed ecosystems, and limited player ownership.


Web2 gaming companies are mainly industry giants, including Electronic Arts (EA), Activision Blizzard, Ubisoft, Nintendo, Microsoft Xbox Game Studios etc., that have produced the most popular games in gaming history. Fortnite, Minecraft, League of Legends, Dota, and Call of Duty are just some of the evergreen games sitting on the throne of all-time popularity.


#### What are some of the issues that Web2 gaming isÂ facing?


Thereâ€™s no denying that Web2 games have brought us countless hours of enjoyment and precious times, but all great things can always be improved.


Here are some of the Web2 gaming pain points:


When a game is hosted on a centralized server thatâ€™s controlled by the gaming company, all player data, game content, and server maintenance is in the hands of the said gaming company.


In centralized Web2 games, players donâ€™t own their in-game digital assets (skins, characters, weapons, accounts, real estate etc.). Instead, the gaming company owns all the in-game assets.


Gaming companies have been heavily criticized for their in-app purchases that have been deemed as predatory, encouraging you to spend more than you can maybe afford.


Centralized servers are more exposed to security breaches. This exposes the in-game assets and player data to loss, theft, fraud, and other types of exploitation.


In Web2 games, pay-to-play is the traditional gaming model where the player needs to pay to access the game, either with an up-front purchase or a subscription model.


### What is Web3Â gaming?


The goal of Web3 gaming is to deliver a more immersive, rewarding, and transparent gaming experience, where the power is shifted from the hands of the gaming company to the hands of the player.


Web3 games are video games that leverage blockchain technology and integrate the principles of decentralization into the gameplay itself, the economics of the game, and the mechanics of gaming.


This is why youâ€™ll also come across names such as blockchain games or decentralized games.


While not nearly as widely popular as Web2 game classics yet, popular Web3 games include Axie Infinity, Decentraland, Crypto Kitties, Sorare, Lost Relics, Gods Unchained etc.


#### How is Web3 gaming helping up the Web2Â game?


Web2 games walked, so Web3 games can now run.


Elevating the current Web2 gaming experience, Web3 games arenâ€™t just about better visuals, stronger processing power, and other classic improvements mentioned in the beginning. Taking gaming to a whole new level, Web3 games offer a whole new way for players to interact with games.


With the use of innovative blockchain technology, Web3 gaming aims to solve some of the most pressing issues of Web2 gaming brought on by centralization.


By integrating the principles of decentralization and using blockchain technology to store in-game assets, transactions, and other game-related data as tokens on the blockchain, the power is transferred from a central authority to the players.


Decentralized hosting and decentralized storage used in Web3 games are more reliable, secure, and transparent methods of hosting and storing content than centralized servers that always come with a single point of failure.


As players gain true ownership of their in-game assets with the use of blockchain technology, gamers can buy, sell, trade, or even use these assets across multiple games or platforms.


Player empowerment offers more control to gamers over their gaming experience, including the ability to make decisions about asset ownership, trading, and participation in in-game governance.


Some Web3 in-game assets or characters obtained in one game can be used or transferred to other compatible games or platforms.


Some Web3 in-game assets hold real-world value, allowing players to trade these assets in secondary markets.


Blockchain technology can be used to ensure the fairness of in-game mechanics, such as random number generation, which is often crucial in games of chance.


Instead of the classic pay-to-play principle, Web3 gaming employs the play-to-earn concept that allows players to earn revenue, including cryptocurrency or in-game assets, by playing games.


### The main differences between Web2 and Web3Â gaming


Letâ€™s sum up the main differences between Web2 and Web3 gaming, shall we?


Still widely popular, Web2 gaming offers the traditional gaming experience where the gaming company is king, exercising centralized control over all aspects of gaming, including in-game assets, its economy, infrastructure, and monetization. The in-game content and infrastructure are stored and hosted on a centralized server that can be exposed to security risks.


By integrating the principles of decentralization and leveraging blockchain technology, Web3 gaming offers an entirely new way for players to interact with games. Gone are the days when gaming companies were the only actors writing the rules of the game.


Shifting the power to the hands of the players, Web3 gaming introduces true ownership of in-game assets and content, decentralized gameplay, and play-to-earn opportunities.


Web3 games offer the future of gaming thatâ€™s all about player empowerment and transparency, enhanced security and privacy, fairness, and player-driven economies.


### The state of Web3 gamesÂ today


Even with the enormous play-to-earn boom, Web3 games still arenâ€™t anywhere near as popular as Web2 games. However, this just means thereâ€™s more than enough space for growth.


Perhaps one of the things holding people back is the question: can we completely trust these new technologies? The honest answer would be that it depends on the level of decentralization and the safety level of the blockchain technology used in the game. But then again, time has proven we canâ€™t completely trust traditional Web2 gaming technology, either, right?


As the focus shifts to play-to-earn, joining fun with sustainable in-game rewards, Web3 gaming is just taking off.
