### Embedded wallets: Web2 experience, Web3 security


#### The road to Web3 is still paved with many roadblocks, starting with complex digital wallets. For some, they are confusing and frustrating — but they don’t need to be!


Web3 is changing how we think about and interact with digital assets. The bridge from Web2 can sometimes mean dealing with complex processes, so simplifying the onboarding should be the first step to ease that transition.


After all, even the most user-friendly Web3 functionalities and services are meaningless if the entry point to Web3 is too tricky to navigate.


That’s where Apillon’s embedded wallets come in. This technology is making it easier than ever to access blockchain. So, let’s break it down and see what’s what.


### What’s stopping mass adoption?


Web3 has excellent potential and promises great benefits, but it’s not always easy to use. If you’ve ever tried setting up a digital wallet, you know the process can feel overwhelming. The most common barriers:


All these factors make Web3 a tough sell for users who aren’t crypto- or tech-savvy. It’s time to simplify the experience.


Yes, the term “wallet” usually makes us think of something entirely different from a login method. But, just like our physical wallets hold more than just money — like ID cards, loyalty cards, and library memberships — Web3 wallets serve multiple purposes, too.


That said, when a product delivers a seamless user experience, its name or underlying technology doesn’t matter.


### Front-row fun, backstage blockchain


Embedded wallets, also known as Wallet-as-a-Service (WaaS) are a game-changer. These wallets can be built directly into your dapps or websites, eliminating the need for complex setup processes.


Instead of dealing with private keys and seed phrases, your users will log in using something as simple as your email and a code. The wallet handles all the complex stuff in the background, making Web3 access as easy as logging into your social media account.


Here’s why embedded wallets are the future:


Apillon’s embedded wallet service is powered by the Oasis and its confidential smart contracts that securely generate and store private keys that are fully encrypted and never exposed. This way, the service offers the best of both worlds: a seamless user experience and top-notch security.

### Apillon: Simplicity in connecting


Embedded wallets like your favorite concert. You’re there for the show, not the backstage chaos. Your audience only sees the seamless, exciting performance and everything front and center. Behind the curtain, all the heavy lifting happens, but it’s invisible to the user. And that’s the power of embedded wallets.


We handle the blockchain complexity behind the scenes so users can focus on the experience while developers keep the business moving in the background. It’s all about delivering innovation upfront without exposing the technical grind.


By focusing on embedded wallet technology, we’re making Web3 more accessible without sacrificing security. Whether sending assets to a Web3 account or interacting with dapps, Apillon’s embedded wallets make the process easy, secure, and fast.
