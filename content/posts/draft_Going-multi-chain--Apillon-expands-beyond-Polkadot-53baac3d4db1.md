140,000+ developers signed up.  111,000+ Web3 projects deployed. 340,000+ transactions processed.


Apillon has been making Web3 development easy, scalable, and frustration-free — but until now, it’s been all within the Polkadot ecosystem.


And while Polkadot remains our home base, Web3 isn’t a gated community. It’s a network of networks, and we’re ready to bring Apillon’s developer-friendly infrastructure to more chains, ecosystems, and builders.


### Why Apillon goes multi-chain?


Because Web3 is about options, not limitations.


Developers shouldn’t be locked into a single ecosystem if their vision takes them elsewhere. By expanding Apillon’s services beyond Polkadot, we’re allowing teams to build where they feel at home — without sacrificing the ease and efficiency we’ve always delivered.


And the best part? It doesn’t change a thing about how you use Apillon. The same user-friendly APIs, streamlined integrations, and no-code/low-code tooling — just with more chains to choose from.


### First stop: Optimistic rollup L2s


We’re starting with EVM-compatible Layer 2 chains using optimistic rollups. These chains have cracked the code on scalability without sacrificing Ethereum’s security.


Unlike ZK rollups, which verify every transaction upfront with complex math magic, optimistic rollups assume everything’s good unless proven otherwise — kind of like the “innocent until proven guilty” of scaling solutions. This approach makes them faster and cheaper for most real-world applications.


First in line for Apillon integration:


Each of these chains brings something unique to the table, but they all share a common goal: making Web3 development more accessible, just like Apillon.


### What’s in it for you?


Adding L2s means more prospects, better efficiency, and a larger ecosystem to tap into. Whether you’re deploying dapps, minting NFTs, or building next-gen smart contracts, you’ll be free to choose the chain that fits your vision — without compromising on Apillon’s seamless experience.


You get:


### Apillon optimistically rolled out


Pun intended. All the chains are already on the platform and ready for your Web3 journey. All six chains are live on Apillon, ready for you to build, deploy, and scale your Web3 projects with the same simplicity you already know and trust.


Start integrating today — explore the chains, test your deployments, and bring your dapps to the L2 ecosystem that fits your vision.
