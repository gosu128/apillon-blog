### Thank you!


An immensely fruitful Evaluation period on Polimec transitioned into the Crowdsale period.


Apillon is thrilled to have such a loyal and supportive fanbase. We are grateful to every one of you, evaluators, for having performed such careful due diligence and evaluating in favor of Apillon’s venture 🙏


### Next stop, $NCTR Crowdsale!


In Apillon’s $NCTR Crowdsale, approximately 2 million $NCTR tokens will be available for supporters and investors to contribute to the growth and development of Apillon’s project.


The $NCTR Crowdsale will take place on the Polimec fundraising platform, where Apillon’s offering can be found. Since the sale is private, all relevant information is accessible in the Apillon Data Room, but only to those with a Deloitte KYC/AML Credential.

#### 2. Buy/hold PLMC tokens


To complete the process of purchasing $NCTR, you have to own some PLMC tokens as you go as they will need to be bonded. Why and how much PLMC you need depends on your participating amount (read more HERE).

If you don’t own any PLMC yet, there are a few ways to reach some:

#### 4. Connect Substrate address


You can connect either Polkadot.{js}, Subwallet, or Talisman wallet. After connecting your wallet, you must select the account with enough funds in one of the currencies, acceptable in the $NCTR Crowdsale — USDC, USDT, or DOT.

#### 5. Verify KYC Credential


Connect your Deloitte wallet and prove your identity with your personal KYC. Once set, you’ll get the green light to proceed to the actual funding round — and get a hold of your own $NCTR tokens.


#### 6. Proceed to the participation part


Fill out the crucial fields, such as selecting the preferred currency and entering the currency amount. Below, the amounts will automatically convert to NCTR and PLMC, which will be bonded.


#### 7. Contribution tokens


Serving as proof of participation, contribution tokens will be deposited into your wallet upon transferring your funds. After closing the funding round, these will automatically convert into the corresponding NCTRs and you will then become a part of the $NCTR meadow ✨

### Why $NCTR token?


As the first Web3 development platform in the Polkadot ecosystem, Apillon has the power to significantly polish Web3 onboarding and, ultimately, facilitate the widespread adoption of blockchain technology.


The Apillon platform lowers the tech barrier for Web2 developers to enter Web3 and promises an even faster building for seasoned Web3 developers; it is bound to boost the adoption of blockchain in the years to come.


Apillon just passed 130,000 platform users, indicating an exponentially growing interest in no-code-low-code platforms on the Web3 market.


After raising $3.6M from various VCs and Angel investors (2021) and an exclusive Community round (2022), the Apillon team is now engaging with the community for the last time before a proper $NCTR take-off.


$NCTR Crowdsale is a perfect — and the last! — opportunity for contributors to acquire $NCTR tokens before they go public.
