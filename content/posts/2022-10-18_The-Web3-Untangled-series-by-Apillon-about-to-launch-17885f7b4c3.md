### The Web3 Untangled series by Apillon about toÂ launch


#### By featuring key Web3 players, the series aims to demonstrate the role of Polkadot parachains in the real economy and to bring blockchain technology to simpler terms for stronger adoption among Web3 builders.


In the battle of building scalable Web3 networks, Polkadot has been gaining momentum and rising exponentially since its inception. Its built-in interoperability allows for different types of chains in the ecosystem to work together and interact in a secure way.


Polkadot has proven time and again that it serves as an excellent base layer for building a decentralized economy, society, and other ways of exchanging data and value in a digital world.


By delivering common network security grounds and the capacity of cross-chain communication, it provides its parachains with a reliable environment and complete freedom in designing their operational and governance structures to fine-tune their distinct functionalities serving specific use cases.


### Web3 is the future. Apillon brings it to theÂ masses.


Blockchain technology is currently the sole adequate answer to all current centralization and data ownership issues. However, Web3 developers still face numerous challenges when building a decentralized future. For one, developing a Web3 project from scratch is, still, way more costly than one would imagineâ€Šâ€”â€Šin terms of dedicated time, invested effort and end-road success potential.

[The challenges of building on Web3The journey of building decentralized applications from start to finish is an uphill struggle, packed with wrong turnsâ€¦medium.com](https://medium.com/apillon/the-challenges-of-building-on-web3-4944e4bb3a8)

Apillon aims to get the ball rolling on the mass adoption of Web3-adjacent solutions by continuously empowering the builders of the decentralized world. As a Web3 development platform, Apillon empowers developers to build in the Polkadot ecosystem.


Through simple API connectivity to the Polkadot parachains and other key services, it allows them to easily build dapps and Web3 products without spending years learning and mastering the underlying blockchain technology.


### Web3 Untangled to educate andÂ inspire


Building new parachains, solutions and protocols does not automatically help raise awareness and boost the adoption of Web3. Instead of concentrating primarily on a parachain level, the Web3 ecosystem should focus more on the production line, Web3 end-products, their UX and UI design, and the community building around them.


The Web3 Untangled series aims to promote the usability and use cases of the Polkadot parachains and other key players of the Polkadot ecosystem through the prism of Apillon and the perspective of Web3 builders.


The content devoted to each Web3 actor will consist of two content pieces. First, a written high-level overview will deliver a practical example on how to use certain technology in Web3 projects. And, second, a live video panel will host guest speakers representing the featured parachains to touch upon more technical ins and outs of the service they provide.


Get your notebooks ready and jump down the Web3 hole with the field experts, visionaries and other key characters of the Polkadot ecosystem.
