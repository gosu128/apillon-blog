### Optimistic vs. ZK rollups: practical vs. futuristic


#### Optimistic rollups win today with lower costs, easier deployment, and proven scalability. Here’s why they’re the top choice over ZK rollups (for now).


Optimistic rollups currently dominate among developers because they strike the right balance between scalability, security, and ease of implementation. While ZK (zero-knowledge) rollups promise game-changing efficiency, they’re still evolving.


Here’s why optimistic rollups remain the go-to choice today.


### 1. Easier to implement


Optimistic rollups are developer-friendly. They operate on a simple assumption: everything is valid unless proven otherwise. This reduces the need for complex cryptographic proofs, making them easier to design and deploy. ZK rollups, on the other hand, rely on heavy-duty math and advanced cryptography, which adds complexity and computational overhead.


### 2. Cost efficiency (for now)


ZK rollups promise ultra-low fees in the future, but today, their cryptographic computations are expensive. Optimistic rollups require less computation, keeping transaction fees lower and making them a cost-effective solution right now.


### 3. Seamless Ethereum compatibility (EVM-friendly)


Optimistic rollups plug right into Ethereum’s existing ecosystem. Devs can use Solidity, Hardhat, and familiar tooling without extra work. ZK rollups? They’re still catching up to full EVM compatibility, meaning additional hurdles for developers.


### 4. Proven adoption and real-world use


Optimistic rollups power giants like Optimism and Arbitrum, processing millions of transactions and supporting top-tier dapps. They’ve been tested at scale, making them a proven solution. While ZK rollups are promising, they’re newer and still undergoing battle-testing.


### 5. Flexible dispute resolution


Optimistic rollups use fraud proofs, allowing disputed transactions to be challenged within a set window. This system is straightforward and already secures real-world applications. ZK rollups rely on cryptographic validity proofs, which are mathematically sound but come with added complexity.


### The bottom line


Optimistic rollups lead the pack because they’re practical, cost-effective, and ready to go. ZK rollups are the future, promising lower fees, enhanced security, and privacy, but they’re not fully there yet. For developers who want scalability today without sacrificing Ethereum-level security, optimistic rollups are the smart move.
