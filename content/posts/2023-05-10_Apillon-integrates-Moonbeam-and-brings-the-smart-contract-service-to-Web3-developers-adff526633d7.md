### Apillon integrates Moonbeam and brings the smart contract service to Web3 developers


#### With the newly-integrated smart contract connectivity, a new era of intuitive deployment of Web3 assets, NFTs included, is right¬†ahead.


In Apillon‚Äôs continuous quest to expand the array of services on its Web3 development platform, Apillon and Moonbeam Network come together to provide an NFT smart contract deployment feature. Not only to best cater to Web3 developers‚Äô needs but to provide the most favorable way to reach a universal Web3 adoption among end users.

The collaboration between Apillon and Moonbeam Network is set to make it even easier, faster, and more resource-efficient for Web3 builders to deploy fully functional dapps. The first Moonbeam-based service on the Apillon platform consists of the NFT collection deployment and minting, combined with decentralized storage to keep the NFT metadata intact and secure along the way, and an NFT Collection landing page code snippet which can immediately get deployed to Apillon Web3 Hosting. Together, they provide a full Web3, decentralized stack.

While Apillon strives to empower Web3 builders with easy-to-use and resource-efficient developer tools, the Moonbeam Network is hard at work to pave the way for Ethereum developers eager to expand to the Polkadot space. In close collaboration with Moonbeam, the Apillon platform is bringing the best traits of both spheres and providing Web3 developers to build with EVM compatibility.


#### Moonbeam parachain, designed for developers


Moonbeam Network, one of the initial and most prolific Polkadot parachains, is a smart contract platform for building cross-chain connected applications that can access users, assets, and services on any chain. By uniting functionality from Ethereum, Cosmos, Polkadot and more into a single platform, Moonbeam solves today‚Äôs fragmented user experience‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääunlocking true interoperability and paving the way for the next generation of applications.


The Moonbeam platform uses integrated cross-chain messaging to allow developers to create smart contracts that access services across many remote blockchains. This approach, plus Moonbeam‚Äôs developer-friendly EVM platform, vast tool support, and modern Substrate architecture creates the ideal development environment for building connected applications.


Moonbeam simplifies the developer experience by combining full Ethereum compatibility with the power of Polkadot, including scalability, cross-chain integrations, and on-chain governance.

#### You say Moonbeam, we say¬†NFTs


Non-fungible tokens and their limitless potential is spreading across industries and becoming a synonym for creating memorable experiences and strengthening numerous online communities. As NFTs have introduced users to the disruptive benefits of blockchain technology, they represent one of the wider paths to Web3 adoption.


And if we want the Web3 future to be at our doorsteps, there has to be a way to provide a user-friendly, decentralized and simplified Web3 building. It‚Äôs precisely for that reason Apillon is launching its third fully-fledged Moonbeam-based NFT service that is, combined with other platform services, tackling the most common issues NFTs have had since its inception.


The Apillon way of deploying and minting NFT collections checks a few boxes:


#### Apillon platform at your service(s)


Right now, Apillon is expanding the platform services horizontally. Moonbeam Network, while promising the world of smart contract options for developers to build on blockchain, is momentarily providing the NFT smart contracts. In the future, more Moonbeam-powered smart contracts will be made available for even smoother Web3 building.
