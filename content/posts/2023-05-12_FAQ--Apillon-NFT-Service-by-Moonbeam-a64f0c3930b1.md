### Why NFTs?


#### Why should you create an NFT collection?


NFTs represent a unique work, product, or asset created or owned by you. By inscribing it on the blockchain, your one-of-a-kind creations or products can live permanently on the network and allow easy traceability of authenticity and ownership.


Your NFTs can be yours alone, or you can share them, gift them, airdrop them, or sell them at an online marketplace.


#### What are the use cases ofÂ NFTs?


NFT ownership comes with many benefits besides holding a unique asset in a wallet. Here are just some of the many different use cases for NFTs, their creators, and owners.


ðŸ‘‰ Visual art: NFTs are a great way for artists to monetize their creativity, take direct ownership of their artwork, and tackle counterfeits. Storing art pieces on a blockchain ensures verification and traceability of authenticity.


ðŸ‘‰ Music: Musicians and producers can use NFT collections to monetize their work by directly selling or streaming songs, bypassing the need for a middleman. They can earn royalties, offer fans unique merchandise, or sell NFT tickets for concerts or events.


ðŸ‘‰ Gaming: In the gaming industry, NFTs represent in-game assets, such as rare items or skins. The gaming NFT market is booming as players can own and trade these items, unlock advanced features or progress faster through the game.


ðŸ‘‰ Collectibles: Collectors can own or trade unique and rare digital items in the form of NFTs, from physical trading cards and comics to virtual real estate.


ðŸ‘‰ Social media: Content creators can tie stronger relationships with their community by offering an exclusive gateway to their content via NFTs, such as behind-the-scenes footage, early access to new videos, personalized shout-outs, or invites to closed communication chatrooms.


ðŸ‘‰ Brand identity: By creating a collection of NFTs with a common theme, style, or subject matter, brands can enhance the experience for customers who buy and own an NFT with the brandâ€™s signature.


#### What if youâ€™re not an artist but have a cool idea forÂ NFTs?


You donâ€™t need special artistic skills to create a great NFT collection. Use AI and generative software to generate countless unique NFT pieces based on defined traits. Such tools include Midjourney and Stable Diffusion for graphic art or Soundraw for music.

[Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/home/?callbackUrl=%2Fapp%2F)
[Stable Diffusion](https://stablediffusionweb.com/)
[Soundraw](https://soundraw.io/)

All you need to do is choose the input format and come up with the traitsâ€Šâ€”â€Šthe code will do the rest.

### Creating NFTs withÂ Apillon


#### How to create an NFT collection withÂ Apillon?


To learn how to deploy your NFT collection on Moonbeam with Apillon, please refer to this guide. ðŸ‘‡

[Guide: NFT Service Pt. 2â€Šâ€”â€ŠCreate and deploy NFT collection on MoonbeamIn this guide, you will learn step-by-step how to go from raw data and files to a permanently deployed NFT collectionâ€¦blog.apillon.io](https://blog.apillon.io/guide-nft-service-pt-2-create-and-deploy-nft-collection-on-moonbeam-2d7eedf79756)

#### What do you need to create an NFT collection withÂ Apillon?


You can create an NFT collection using visual, audio, video, or other material of your choice. The ERC-721 non-fungible token standard packs any format into permanently stored content on the blockchain. Create a folder of files youâ€™d like to deploy as NFTs locally.


You will also need NFT metadata in a CSV fileâ€Šâ€”â€Šyou can create it by following the example on the Apillon platform.

[example](https://app-staging.apillon.io/files/example.csv)

Thatâ€™s pretty much it. You donâ€™t need any Web3 development knowledgeâ€Šâ€”â€Šthe NFT Service wizard takes you through the drag-and-drop process step-by-step.


#### What is NFT metadata?


NFT metadata is the backbone of your collection and communicates the essential information of your NFT filesâ€Šâ€”â€Šthe file name and format, date of creation, owner, etc.


It can also be comprised of certain attributes that make an NFT one of a kind: from color or serial number in digital representations of physical items, attire and accessories of generative NFT characters, to music genre and featured artists in audio NFT.


As an essential component of your NFT collection, metadata should be managed and stored carefully. To ensure its permanent access free of third-party intervention, Apillon stores your metadata on a decentralized network with Apillon Web3 Storage bucket, Crust Network, and IPFS.

[Apillon Web3 Storage bucket, Crust Network, and IPFS](https://wiki.apillon.io/build/2-web3-services.html#web3-storage)

#### Why should you create NFTs withÂ Apillon?


Creating an unstoppable NFT collection in a matter of minutes with zero development costs in one spot has never been easier.


Deployed with Apillon, your NFT collection will be safe from any external intrusions, hence, unstoppable.


The process of deploying and minting your NFTs is easy and intuitive, and allows you to display your NFT collection on your own website or create a secure and decentrally-hosted landing page via IPFS.


#### How does Apillon ease the process of deploying an NFT collection?


Deploying an NFT collection from scratch requires mastering complex technical knowledge of blockchain technology. Even if youâ€™ve got the technical skills, the process could take hours or even days.


Doing it manually, youâ€™d need to write smart contracts that would define the rules and characteristics of your NFTs, deploy it on the chosen network, and select a platform to create the collection before it lands in your wallet or a marketplace.


Of course, there are other tools that allow you to launch an NFT collection easily. With Apillon, though, you can do it on Moonbeam, an EVM-compatible Polkadot parachain that allows easy building of smart contracts. This allows you to integrate your NFTs into other apps or Web3 products.


Besides, decentralized hosting of your files and metadata is embedded in the process and makes your collection unstoppable from third-party impact.


### Displaying and sellingÂ NFTs


#### How to display your NFTs collection?


Once deployed, you can display your NFTs on either your existing website or use the Apillon NFT collection website template.


In both cases, you can use the code from the Apillon GitHub repository, fork it, customize and adjust the logic to suit your website, and redeploy with Web3 Hosting.

[Apillon GitHub repository](https://github.com/Apillon-web3/nft-template)
[Web3 Hosting](https://wiki.apillon.io/build/2-web3-services.html#web3-hosting)

This allows you to showcase your NFTs exactly where you want to, bypassing marketplaces or third-party platforms.


#### Where can I sell myÂ NFTs?


You can list your NFT collection on multiple digital NFT marketplaces, including tofuNFT, Blockmate, and Chainers.
