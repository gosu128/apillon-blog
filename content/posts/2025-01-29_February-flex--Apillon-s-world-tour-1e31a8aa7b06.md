Three cities. Three conferences. One suitcase. No sleep. Also, no private jet. But Apillon is about to speed-run the Web3 globe, and we’re taking you along for the ride.


First stop — NFTs in Paris. Then, a deep dive into blockchain in Hong Kong. And finally, a desert-tech adventure in Doha.


Buckle up. Here’s where we’re headed.


### 1. Paris, NFTs, and Apillon: A love triangle


From February 13 to 14, we’ll be at NFT Paris, where Web3 meets high fashion, fine art, and overpriced croissants. This isn’t just Europe’s biggest NFT event — it’s where 20,000+ visitors and 400+ speakers gather to talk generative AI, DePIN, and the future of digital ownership.

Apillon is heading in with one goal: exploring how NFTs, Embedded wallets and Simplets can make life easier for builders, creators, and brands. We’re here to chat, network, and maybe (definitely) test how well Web3 pairs with French wine.


### 2. Hong Kong bound: Skyline, smart contracts and us


Next, from February 18 to 20, we’re heading to Consensus Hong Kong 2025. This is the event for blockchain insiders, investors, and visionaries looking to bridge East and West in the Web3 world. Deals will be made, debates will be had, and Apillon will be right in the mix.

We’re here to talk real-world use cases, integrations, and why frictionless Web3 infra isn’t a dream — it’s already happening. Plus, we can’t wait to see how Asia’s tech scene is shaping the future of digital assets.


We’re excited to explore potential collaborations to upgrade our platform’s offerings and expand our reach in the Asian market.


### 3. Doha Diaries: Web Summit Qatar Awaits


Finally, from February 23 to 26, we’ll be in Doha for Web Summit Qatar 2025, where 7,500+ founders, investors, and tech leaders will be scheming up the future. Think big ideas, bigger funding rounds, and enough networking to leave the most extroverted people dreaming about a quiet room.

Apillon’s game plan? Showcasing how easy Web3 development can be when you have the right tools. We’ll discuss how our plug-and-play infrastructure makes blockchain more accessible to businesses beyond the usual crypto crowd.


### See you on the road?


Apillon is thrilled to be part of this melting pot of ideas, where we’ll showcase our platform’s capabilities and explore opportunities to collaborate with tech enthusiasts from around the globe.


If you’re attending any of these, let’s talk Web3 over coffee, dim sum, or a Doha sunset. Find us, ping us, or just follow along as we bring back fresh insights, new partnerships, and maybe an extra load of conference swag.
