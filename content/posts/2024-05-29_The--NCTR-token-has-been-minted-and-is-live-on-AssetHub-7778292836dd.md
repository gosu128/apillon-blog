Dear Apillonians, itâ€™s here. The $NCTR token has seen the light of day. âœ¨


Jump into the details of its minting and what you can expect in the following weeks.


### $NCTR live onÂ AssetHub


Apillonâ€™s native $NCTR token was minted yesterday, May 28, 2024, on AssetHub, a common good Polkadot parachain.


According to the $NCTR launch roadmap, its minting is directly tied to the following:

[The NCTR token is about to launch! Hereâ€™s all you need to know.The day weâ€™ve all been waiting for is on the horizon. In this guide, we outline all the important details in regard toâ€¦blog.apillon.io](https://blog.apillon.io/the-nctr-token-is-about-to-launch-heres-all-you-need-to-know-f7edd86bb76c)

The Apillon team acknowledges the substantial time window between early contribution rounds and yesterdayâ€™s token generation event, and we appreciate everybodyâ€™s patience in token release.


Now, what comes next?


### Early contributor? Donâ€™t skipÂ this!


All early contributors with signed Simple Agreements for Future Tokens (SAFT) are now encouraged to review a DocuSign document containing their contribution data, confirm or edit the wallet address on which they wish to receive the $NCTR tokens, and sign it prior to token distribution.


If youâ€™re one of those early contributors, please check your email inbox for the DocuSign document in the next 24 hours.


After a few weeks of collecting the signed DocuSign papers, Apillon will compile the final list of wallet addresses and the amount of $NCTR tokens each should receive. This data will be deployed inside a smart contract, and the $NCTR will be distributed according to the pre-set schedules.


### $NCTR distribution


In yesterdayâ€™s minting on AssetHub, a total supply of 150,000,000 $NCTR tokens has been created.


According to the vesting schedules that apply to different contribution rounds, a share of $NCTR tokens will be unlocked immediately (30% of the funds delegated to the early, Pre-Seed participants), and the rest will be unlocked periodically.


See detailed distribution below. ðŸ‘‡


### Next stop:Â DEXes


In the following weeks, Apillon will set up technical conditions for token distribution and public accessibility, including the transfer to the Moonbeam Network and trading on the Stellaswap and HydraDX decentralized exchanges.


This will introduce $NCTR to the public trading arena and increase its crypto market exposure.


### $NCTR AirdropÂ rewards


The incentivization campaign that took place in the past few months on the Apillon platform, the $NCTR Airdrop, will distribute the $NCTR rewards to eligible wallet accounts in the weeks after the token distribution to early contributors is complete.
