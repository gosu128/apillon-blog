### How Apillon changes the way Web3 products areÂ built


#### Apillon lowers the entry barrier and brings the development of Web3 products and apps down to just a couple of steps and a few lines ofÂ code.

The increasing use of legacy programming languages and environments has led to solutions that ease the developersâ€™ work, allowing them to devote more time to perfecting the outcome instead of dealing with the basics of utilized technologies.


Web3 is built upon an entirely new infrastructure, unique in its offering and programming setup. But its aim remains the sameâ€Šâ€”â€Što serve as many users and developers as possible. Apillon makes it more easily accessible and puts it into practice faster.


### Challenges of building inÂ Web3


Many developers and businesses still find Web3 intimidating for various reasons. For one, it takes a serious skill set to build products utilizing technologies for decentralized management successfully.


But also, the marketing narrative around Web3 has unintentionally turned it into a seemingly private club of only the heavily publicized projects.


The barrier to entry to Web3 could and should be much lower. Web3 developers should be given a streamlined and non-messy way of building products that adapts to their routine workflow. This way, they could focus more on the functionality of the result and spend less energy diving into every nook and cranny of the technology infrastructure.


#### Heterogeneous sharding ofÂ Polkadot


A simplified and unified approach would specifically benefit the key Web ecosystem, Polkadot, due to its particular architectural nature.

For an insider, this heterogeneity provides excellent opportunities for building use-case-oriented solutions. But to a Web3 newbie, accessing parachainsâ€™ features and combining them is quite a challenge:


#### The glue holding shardsÂ together


Apillon is a unified Web3 development platform that addresses the issues above.


Primarily, it binds Polkadot parachains together and provides developers with easy access to their unique features via dedicated APIs. Developers can build Web3 solutions for business, individuals, or P2P use without deep-diving into each parachainâ€™s technological prerequisites and specifics, which saves time, effort, and invested resources.


Plus, existing Web3 projects can be upgraded easily by adding more parachains and new features, thus covering more use cases and expanding their growth potential.


Given the early stage of the blockchain ecosystem and the infancy of Web3, developers will need to keep up with a long trajectory of future changes, security tweaks, and functionality updates to keep their Web3 projects alive. This could take a heavy toll on the project budget, heavier than the funds invested in the initial development.


To streamline the development of Web3 products and make it more user- and budget-friendly, a development platform that integrates automatic updates was only a matter of time.


### Developing a Web3 product fromÂ scratch


Due to the complexity of blockchain technology, individual stacks, and unique sets of requirements on each network and protocol, developing new solutions on Web3 is no walk in the park.


When building on Web3, be it within the Polkadot ecosystem or general, developers face challenges that lack proper addressing.


To build a Web3 product from scratch, a developer needs to do (at least) the following:


### Developing a Web3 product withÂ Apillon


With Apillon, the Web3 development process is radically different.


The Apillon platform abstracts the intricacy of linked parachains and delivers them in an easy-to-use format. Developers can start building a Web3 product right away, bypassing underlying technological complexity.


#### Example #1: Building on KILT Protocol*


To build a simple Web3 app utilizing KILT Protocol for user authentication from scratch, a developer needs to do (at least) the following:


Using the Apillon platform, on the other hand, a developer simply calls a function (e. g., createUserWithEmailAndPassword) from the Apillon SDK and sends the required parameters. The function creates a fully working user DID in the back end.


#### Example #2: Building on CrustÂ Network*


To build a simple Web3 app utilizing Crust for file storage from scratch, a developer needs to do (at least) the following:


Using the Apillon platform, on the other hand, a developer simply calls a function (e. g.,getStorage()) and moves the files to a decentralized, pinned service provided by Crust and IPFS.


In both cases, the resources spent on building a functional Web3 application with Apillon are significantly reduced, and the productâ€™s go-to-market trajectory much shorter and streamlined.


### Easier access, fasterÂ adoption


Apillon lowers the entry barrier to Web3 and provides developers with new, simplified means to create working products on Polkadot parachainsâ€Šâ€”â€Šsimply by using legacy systems and standard programming knowledge.


A developer building a Web3 app using the Apillon platform can simply attach the needed service, call a function, and code it to suit the needs of the product.


With its complete set of tools, the Apillon platform aims to support thousands of developers, regardless of their background, to onboard the Web3 train, and to boost the adoption of individual Polkadot/Kusama parachains and distributed technologies in the real economy.
