### Why gaming and IPFS are the perfect match


#### Here’s how to use distributed file storage and decentralized web hosting in gaming.


With the rising popularity of collectibles in the gaming industry, Web3 and gaming are a solid genre fit.


With Web3 seeping into the gaming industry, new possibilities are arising for gamers who are gaining greater control, real digital ownership (e.g., of in-game items such as skins and weapons or tools), and even the possibility to earn cryptocurrency as they play with the play-to-earn principle (P2E).


The foundation for Web3 gaming is still evolving, and today, we’re looking deeper into the storage layer and the importance of decentralized data storage and decentralized web hosting as the pillars of Web3 gaming.


### Wherein lies the magic of Web3 gaming?


Decentralization, security, ownership, NFTs, and blockchain technology are the leading principles in revolutionizing the Web3 gaming space.


The innovative technology isn’t there solely to improve the purely technical side of gaming, e.g., bring better graphics, etc., but to change how we interact with games.


Adding the component of owning, sharing, earning, and creating on top of playing, players can now take digital ownership of in-game assets with NFTs. The same in-game assets might already exist in traditional gaming but could not be freely sold or traded by the players themselves.


That’s all great and very exciting, but to get there and then stay there, a solid foundation has to be laid down first.


As Web3 gaming eliminates the need for a centralized authority that would control all the assets, the question that comes to mind is the following:


#### Where should all these in-game assets, files, and data be securely stored?


The answers can vary in terms of providers, but the one thing they should all have in common is decentralized storage and decentralized web hosting.

If you’re building a Web3 game and looking for storage and hosting options, you should choose among reputable decentralized storage providers.


### IPFS data storage comes to the rescue once again


IPFS (Inter-Planetary File System) is one of the most commonly used decentralized protocols that offers an alternative to the traditional HTTP.

In short, instead of relying on a centralized server, IPFS offers a decentralized and distributed network of IPFS nodes. Content that gets uploaded and pinned to IPFS is safe from outages, censorship, data breaches, hacking, loss of data, and other risks that come with traditional storage providers.


If one node goes down, the copies of the content are still stored and accessible on numerous other IPFS nodes.


Once the content is uploaded, it cannot be changed. It would have to be deleted and re-uploaded — this guarantees immutability and prevents data tampering.


As decentralized web hosting and decentralized data storage eliminate the need for a central authority, the power can be transferred from the corporation to the hands of the players.


#### Why is IPFS the perfect choice for the storage layer of your Web3 game?


The next question that would follow all the benefits of IPFS would be:


#### Where can I get IPFS-supported decentralized data storage and decentralized web hosting for the best price and the most seamless UI?


If you care about the lowest cost and the highest responsiveness, there’s only one right answer: the Apillon platform.
