### $NCTR Airdrop rewards Web3 builders on the Apillon platform


#### In light of the upcoming Apillon TGE, all active platform users will be rewarded with free $NCTR tokens of appreciation.


From its inception until now, the Apillon platform has gained over 4,000 users who worked on more than 3,100 Web3 projects and provided constructive feedback that helped Apillon improve the overall user experience.


Together with a round of applause, we reserved a big fat bag of 1 million free $NCTR tokens to reward developers building Web3 with Apillon.

### 1. Who is eligible for the $NCTR Airdrop?


All users who have created an account on the Apillon platform between December 2022 and the $NCTR Airdrop closing date (Apillon TGE) and will connect their Astar wallet are eligible and will receive free $NCTR through $NCTR Airdrop.


On the Apillon platform dashboard, there is a special section dedicated to $NCTR Airdrop, where you will find all the info, details, and your accumulated $NCTR token amount.


### 2. How to receive free $NCTR tokens?


At this moment, nothing is lost yet. You can still sign up on the platform and gain access to free $NCTR tokens. How?

[here](https://app.apillon.io/register?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=register_link1&utm_id=airdrop)

Once registered on the platform and ready to go, you can check your progress and ensure you have completed all the necessary steps to obtain $NCTR.


### 3. How to earn additional $NCTR tokens?


Well, here’s where the fun starts! You can increase your basic reward by completing the Bonus tracks, and we’ll throw in additional $NCTR tokens.


There is a list of all tasks below the tracks so you’ll know exactly what to do, when, and how much they are worth. Before starting, you need to own an account on the platform and have your Astar wallet connected.


If you have already been an active user of the platform before the $NCTR Airdrop period, all your previous activity will be automatically translated into the corresponding value of $NCTR — keep track of the task list and the green checkmarks.


#### Check out the Bonus tracks:


⧓ Refer & Earn


Use this track to invite your friends to the Apillon platform via your referral link. You can find your unique referral link in the $NCTR Airdrop section of the dashboard. Share that link with your friends and earn extra $NCTRs for each successful referral.


☝ Important: Guide your referred friends through additional tasks — in order for you to earn referral points, your referred friends a.k.a. referees must complete a few tasks. They do not automatically provide bonus points for you just by registering on the platform.


⧓ Learn & Earn


You can earn additional $NCTRs by learning about Apillon features and functionalities. No coding knowledge is required; simply use drag-and-drop services and experiment with simpler tasks like storing your files decentrally, etc.


⧓ Build & Earn


Want to go deeper into Web3 with the Apillon platform? Build a dapp, experiment with the platform services with Apillon API, SDK, CLI or use some of the premade templates to unlock the highest $NCTR rewards.


### 4. $NCTR Airdrop timeline


#### February, March


Users register to the platform, connect their wallets, and start performing additional tasks, earning more $NCTR tokens. Apillon will monitor the user activity until Apillon TGE.


#### April, May


During this period, Apillon will launch a Token Generation Event. After TGE is concluded, the $NCTR Airdrop will be executed in a timely matter.
