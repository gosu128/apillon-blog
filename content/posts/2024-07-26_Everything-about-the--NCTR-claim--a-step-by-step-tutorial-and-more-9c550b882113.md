It’s been a couple of long years for our loyal Apillon supporters, tagging along since before we rebranded from Authtrail (AUT) to Apillon. And it’s been worth it!


We appreciate your contributions, which show support and loyalty, and your sharing of the $NCTR bullishness throughout the past few years.


It is why all early contributors (pool and other Authtrail backers) will receive a +15% NCTR bonus as compensation for their patience with the token launch.


### TL;DR


### How to claim your $NCTR — steps


Everything related to $NCTR tokens will be carried out on the Apillon NCTR page— it is a separate Apillon page dedicated to all things $NCTR: claiming the tokens, adding them to your wallet, and sending them cross-chain from Moonbeam to Asset Hub and back, as you will later see fit.

[on the Apillon NCTR page](https://apillon.io/nctr)

There are 4 steps in the process:


#### 1 ⧓ Connect your EVM wallet


First, go to the Apillon NCTR page and connect your EVM-compatible wallet. Be sure to use the wallet address you provided in your latest Simple Agreement of Future Tokens (SAFT).

[Apillon NCTR page](https://apillon.io/nctr)

When you click “Connect wallet,” a pop-up will appear—choose your preferred wallet option. Since the majority will use the MetaMask wallet extension, let’s take a look at that one. The rest of the process from step 2 forward is the same for both wallet options.


So, the wallet browser extension will pop up at the top right. Click “Next” and then “Connect.” You will see a confirmation that the Apillon page is connecting to your MetaMask wallet.


#### 2 ⧓ Use gifted GLMR to cover fees


As $NCTR tokens are launched on the Moonbeam Network, Moonbeam-native GLMR tokens are needed to cover the cost of the transaction to claim $NCTR.


🏅 We went ahead and dropped some $GLMR into your wallet — it should be enough for the first claim transaction.


If you want to get more $GLMR, you have two options on how to get them:

#### 3 ⧓ Claim $NCTR


Got $GLMR? Ready to claim $NCTR and go to the moon? Here we go!


After you’ve successfully connected your wallet, you’ll come to this screen 👇


Click “Claim $NCTR,” and the wallet should open in the top-right corner again, showing the amount of $NCTR tokens to be claimed.


Once you claim, the whole available (unvested) amount will get transferred to your wallet. The process might take a few moments.


You’ll be notified after your $NCTRs are safely claimed. All you have to do now is add them to your wallet so they will appear on the token list.


#### 4 ⧓ Add $NCTR to MetaMask


By clicking on the “Add $NCTR to MetaMask” button, your connected wallet will appear one more time. Click on “Add token,” and the $NCTR token should now be visible on the list of tokens in your wallet.


Voilà, all done! 👏


If you got this message, you are all set — riding off to sunset with your newly acquired $NCTR tokens ❤


You can admire them in your wallet under the tab Tokens. Make sure the network you are connected to is Moonbeam 👇

### Crypto glossary for beginners


… that you must know and understand.


The crypto world can be thrilling. But it can also be overwhelming, with all the words and definitions floating around, especially for crypto newbies that need special care in this special world of Web3 assets.


Let’s check the most important words out so you’ll be able to get as much information as you need from the chart and the NCTR dashboard:


⧓ Contribution round: Here, you see in which contribution round you’ve acquired $NCTR (before $AUT) tokens.


⧓ Vesting schedule: A plan that releases tokens gradually over time to prevent immediate access to all of them.


⧓ Cliff: An initial waiting period during which no tokens are released. After this period, some tokens become available.


⧓ Vesting after cliff: The ongoing release of tokens in parts after the cliff period is over.


⧓ Immediate unlock: A portion of tokens that can be accessed right away without any waiting period.


⧓ Next unlock due: The next date when more tokens will be released to be claimed according to the vesting plan.


⧓ $NCTR bought: The amount of $NCTR you acquired during the contribution round(s).


⧓ 15% bonus $NCTR: The bonus, +15% $NCTR of the bought amount of tokens.


⧓ Total $NCTR: The amount you purchased plus the 15% of added $NCTR as a bonus. This amount represents the total of $NCTR until the end of the vesting period.


⧓ Already claimed $NCTR: $NCTRs that you have already claimed.


⧓ Claimable $NCTR: $NCTRs that are available for claim.


⧓ Vested $NCTR: $NCTRs that will become available for claim gradually over time. Keep track of the Apillon NCTR page to see when the next batch of tokens will be ready to be claimed to your wallet.

2. Why do I need GLMR?


As NCTR tokens are launched on the Moonbeam Network, you’ll need some Moonbeam-based GLMR tokens to cover the claim transaction.


3. How much do I need it?


Each $NCTR transaction will require a tiny portion of GLMR. The current approximation is 0.05 GLMR per transaction, which is approximately $0.0011 (calculated at the time of writing — July 17, 2024). You should have already received some GLMR in your wallet so that should speed things up for your first NCTR claim transaction.


If you are buying $GLMR solely for $NCTR claiming, 1 GLMR will go a long way and enable several claim transactions throughout your whole vesting period.


4. Where can I get GLMR?


You can either buy GLMR using standard paying services like credit card or Google Pay on Transak or, if you already own cryptocurrency, swap some of your assets for GLMR on Hydration or StellaSwap DEXes.

5. Can I pick the amount of $NCTR I want to claim?


The amount you can claim is listed under Claimable $NCTR, and once you claim it, the total available (unvested) amount will be transferred to your wallet. You cannot decide on a random amount.


6. I claimed NCTR but don’t see it in my wallet.


There is an “Add NCTR to MetaMask” button under the button where you’ve claimed your NCTR. When added to your wallet, NCTR tokens should appear on your Tokens list.


7. I cannot claim NCTR.


First of all, have you successfully connected your wallet? If yes, check the chart on the top right and see if there is any Claimable NCTR. If not, your NCTR might be vested, and/or you may have already claimed the available amount. Check the dates under Next unlock due if there’s any NCTR left to be claimed in the future.
