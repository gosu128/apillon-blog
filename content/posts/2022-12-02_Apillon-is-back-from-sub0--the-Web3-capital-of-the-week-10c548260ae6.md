### Apillon is back from sub0, the Web3 capital of the week


#### The two-day gathering of the sharpest minds in Web3 served the latest updates of the Polkadot ecosystem and a wide variety of side events — Apillon’s sub0 dinner and closing party included.


The yearly calendar of Web3-focused events is getting more packed every month. The latest gathering of Web3 developers, fans, and ambassadors unfolded at sub0 Lisbon, Portugal.

### Lisbon, the heart of Web3 for the week


sub0, one of the leading events by Polkadot, brought together developers of layer-1 blockchains as well as adopters of dapps, smart contracts, infrastructure, tooling, XCM-based solutions, and more goodies from the Polkadot stock.


In just two days, the event delivered a range of keynotes and panel discussions, interactive workshops, collaborative sessions, and several side events. Held at the unique LX Factory, it was a mecca for Polkadot and Substrate developers seeking in-person exchange of skills and talks over partnerships and career growth.

Everyone who matters in the Web3 space was there, joined by hundreds of inspiring developers yet to leave their mark in the ecosystem.


And through talks and first-hand feedback from Web3 builders, Apillon proved to be an integral part of the ecosystem and a much-needed aid in its evolution.


### Day 1 — Gavin Wood and Apillon Beta Demo


The first day kicked off with a welcome talk by Björn Wagner, CEO of Parity Technologies. The following schedule was packed with general and tech talks, panels, and workshops by the industry’s leaders — a program not to be missed as it was.


Yet the organizers managed to squeeze in a surprise talk by Dr. Gavin Wood, Founder of Polkadot and Chief Architect of Parity Technologies, and add a cherry on top of the overall great experience.


Gavin Wood took the opportunity to present the upcoming Polkadot roadmap, including some critical points in its governance model. Watch the full talk 👉 here.

#### Apillon Platform Beta Demo presentation


It’s one thing to talk about Web3 and another to see it in practice.


Understanding a developer’s struggle when building Web3 products, we decided to showcase the Apillon platform in all its UI.


In the Apillon demo booth, builders from all backgrounds managed to get a grasp on it and envision building their next Web3 project the easy way.


The demo booth proved to be the right call. Developers from all walks of Web3 life recognized the platform’s value and expressed their interest in Apillon Beta testing.


### Day 2 — Panel with Apillon CEO and sub0 Dinner


On the second day of sub0, the Apillon team went even further.


We took the stage and brought the developer crowd together for an evening special.


#### Matjaž Sobočan on Web3 entries


The Web3 space is welcoming, but it wasn’t always so. The starting points and roads to it are different for every member, but they all lead to the same destination — building the web for future generations.

Apillon CEO, Matjaž Sobočan, discussed the milestones and reasons for setting off on a Web3 journey, and shared experiences with Mangata Network’s Alice un Bob and Lauren Lee from Parity Technology.

#### Evening special — sub0 dinner


The night ended in style — with an evening special, a dinner for Web3 developers, jointly hosted by Apillon and Phala Network. The hugely overbooked event was one of the most anticipated meetups of the week and brought together the most Web3-hungry developers in Lisbon.

In a relaxed atmosphere, we paired technical talks from the Polkadot ecosystem with mouth-watering food to spice up the two-day conference program.


First, Zoé Meckbach, Growth VP at Phala, and Patrik Kogoj, Apillon’s Growth Manager, welcomed the crowd and offered a short insight into what’s cooking at both projects.


After the intro talk, Apillon CEO Matjaž Sobočan took a more concrete approach, dived into the basic platform infrastructure, and explained how Apillon simplifies Web3 development.


And, switching to a technical lingo, Apillon CTO Tadej Vengust delivered insights into Apillon’s technical ins and outs. He also presented our Polkassembly Grant proposal for Apillon DID Vault, developed with the support of the KILT Protocol.


To wrap things up, Joshua Waller, Developer Advocate of Phala Network, offered a brief introduction to Phat contracts and invited the attendees to join their Beta.


After these tech-flavored appetizers, it was time for more casual talks and networking over a glass of wine and a three-course menu. And we’re pleased to see that the guests enjoyed discussing highly complex topics in a relaxed and warm atmosphere.


The Web3 space has many flavors, but it all comes down to people joining in and the power of dialogue. We’re excited and incredibly proud to have brought together builders and thinkers from all corners of the Polkadot ecosystem, including Parity Technologies, the Web3 Foundation, KILT Protocol, Astar, Phala Network, and others.


We had a blast and will continue building a common ground for everyone who wants to add their share, regardless of where they come from.


### Growth begins with people


The Polkadot ecosystem proves to be one of the few spaces that defy the test of time and market. As it continues to evolve, grow, and attract new development power, Apillon aims to become the cornerstone of Polkadot’s and Web3 adoption.


Contributing to the ecosystem with more than code, we will devote our strengths also to bringing the Web3 developers together, in one way or another, to share skills and create a prosperous building environment.


Next up, at the Apillon-hosted second Polkadot Meetup in Ljubljana, joined by speakers from KILT Protocol and RMRK — an event not to be missed.
