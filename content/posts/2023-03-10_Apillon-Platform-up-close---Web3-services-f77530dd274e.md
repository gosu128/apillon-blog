Web3 is more than a thing, it’s a universe of things. Among those, Web3 technologies are what powers all Web3 tools, programs, software, apps, games, NFTs, metaverse, basically everything a user or builder interacts with in a decentralized way.


In this Web3-verse, Polkadot is one of the central figures and has contributed immensely to the ecosystem by introducing a network of powerful, niche-specific, and cross-chain communicatable parachains.

In this post, we explore what a Web3 service constitutes in Apillon and what it brings to the builder community.


### What is a Web3 service?


The key to understanding Web3 services in the context of Apillon is knowing what the Polkadot ecosystem (and many other Web3 players) currently lacks.


#### Easy integration


If you decide to create a Web3 product integrating a Polkadot parachain, you’re off to a long and possibly arduous journey. The obstacles, especially for newbies, have been discussed already, but in short, it takes great skill and knowledge to navigate the technology, protocols, requirements, and frameworks before you can launch, test, tweak and update the outcome.

[have been discussed](https://blog.apillon.io/how-apillon-changes-the-way-web3-products-are-built-ee0adae9b94a#38cc)

To lower the barrier to entry, Apillon defines Web3 services as dedicated Web3 solutions, that is, ready-to-use modules that contain opinionated features and capabilities of Polkadot parachain’s cutting-edge Web3 technologies and allow few-click deployment.


As such, they introduce a new way for builders to implement Web3 technologies, bypassing the typical obstacles and delivering results quicker and with less toll on resources.


#### Joint integration


As mentioned, the Polkadot Network has served as a launchpad for multiple parachains, perfected to serve a unique use case. However, while each parachain is optimized for a niche utility, they are not as easily integrated jointly within the same product. So, when incorporating two or more within an app, for example, you need to master each on their own and make them deliver the intended features jointly on a single interface.


To let you to employ multiple Web3 technologies in your products, Apillon’s Web3 services are mutually connectable and seamlessly work together.


This way, you can create apps that, for instance, are hosted decentrally and thus unstoppable while delivering wallet-based user authentication or other Web3 features, all in just a few clicks.

### Where does Apillon source Web3 services from?


#### Polkadot-originated services


The Apillon platform provides access to Web3 technologies primarily by Polkadot’s parachains, that is, niche-specific XCM chains that allow cross-chain data exchange and are optimized for specific purposes.

[Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/)

Apillon abstracts their innate coding complexity into a suite of sleek and easy-to-use development tools together with API connectivity.


What you get is a direct access to the powerful functionalities of decentralized technologies, now turned into tangible, ready-to-use commands on a sleek user interface.


#### Room for more


While primarily supporting Polkadot parachains, the Apillon platform is agnostic by design towards service providers and technically capable of integrating external chains, tools, etc.


This means you could choose among multiple providers of a particular Web3 service or let the platform curate the choice based on your project’s specifics. Plus, the Apillon development toolbox could be expanded with dedicated tools and UX-enhancing Web3 features that are not purely Web3 services in their essence, such as digital wallets.


As the Apillon team and governing members steer the platform’s evolution and expansion, the newly added Web3 services should improve the adoption of Apillon and Web3 technologies among the builders’ community.

### Which Web3 services does Apillon provide?


At the time of writing, the Apillon platform is in the Beta stage and delivers just a couple of Web3 services sufficient for testing key features.

[Beta stage](https://blog.apillon.io/apillon-launches-an-invitation-only-closed-beta-of-the-web3-development-platform-a075c38273a3)

In the upcoming platform versions, more Web3 services will be integrated and accessible to a broader audience.


#### Web3 Storage


Apillon Web3 Storage is a decentralized storage service powered by Crust Network. By storing website, app, or other files on a decentralized global network of nodes, you can improve their accessibility and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access.

[Crust Network](https://crust.network/)

Apillon Web3 Storage service implements IPFS and Crust Network to pin files on multiple IPFS nodes. Plus, it introduces the concept of storage buckets, allowing for more dynamic use of decentralized storage and Web3 development.

#### Web3 Hosting


As an application of Web3 Storage, Apillon Web3 Hosting is a decentralized hosting service powered, again, by Crust Network. Hosting your website or app on a decentralized network of globally scattered nodes makes it unstoppable and defiant against single-point-of-access censorship.

[Crust Network](https://crust.network/)

Apillon Web3 Hosting implements IPFS and Crust Network to pin files on multiple IPFS nodes. Besides Apillon-native storage buckets, a more dynamic storage option, it also delivers straightforward access to IPNS, making way to on-demand file mutability.

#### Web3 Authentication


And, another Web3 service planned to take a slot on the Apillon platform is Web3 Authentication powered by the KILT Protocol.

[KILT Protocol](https://www.kilt.io/)

The easy access to KILT’s decentralized identifiers or DIDs will allow you to enrich your app or website with decentralized user identification or authentication of digital files and assets. This would improve the security of online data exchange while empowering your apps’ users to be custodians of their valuables, identity included.


#### Web3 services on demand


As a Web3 development enabler, Apillon obviously strives to expand the builders’ playground with more services, tools, features, and opportunities.


Some of the planned services include Web3 data integrity and generating NFT collections, while others will be approved through community vote and Apillon’s internal decision-making.


And, when Apillon governance rolls out to a full extent, everyone will have their say in cherry-picking the Web3 services and tools to be added to the Apillon platform.

### What can you build with Apillon Web3 services?


Each Apillon-supported Web3 service caters to a set of niche use cases. But why go with just one when multiple can be combined and integrated into a single product and adopted by the same user community?


You could either create a Web3 product from scratch or tweak just a feature or two of an existing app or website and bring it to a Web3 level, increasing its security, user privacy, execution, and transparency along the way.

[https://apillon.io/builders](https://apillon.io/builders)

In the context of the Apillon platform, here is what you could build with decentralized technologies.


With Web3 Storage service, you could create a blockchain-based app or website that needs to sustain heavy loads of asset and user data, for example, a metaverse-based social platform or an NFT marketplace.

[Why decentralized storage matters for NFT metadata and your next NFT collectionInstead of overdoing what meets the eye, NFT projects should focus more on metadata and its storage to keep it…blog.apillon.io](https://blog.apillon.io/why-decentralized-storage-matters-for-nft-metadata-and-your-next-nft-collection-b7b90fc3762)

Using the Web3 Computing service, you could build apps, games, or NFT marketplaces that support advanced privacy features and secret messaging. Decentralized computing could help you build Web3 NFT rendering farms, Web3 game servers, game engines, and more.


Or, with the Web3 Authentication service, you could onboard users to your app using a self-sovereign digital identity, either as a sole option or together with standard Web2 options, such as email or social log-in, for enhanced user privacy.

### The API-way to parachains


While the original technical nature of supported parachains is quite complex, Apillon boils it down to just a few commands. Still, more advanced users can devote more time to coding their way to Web3 with API access, ample SDKs, and easy-to-navigate documentation.


Instead of having to research native docs, configure and integrate the parachain, manage its native token and file expiry, test, launch, tweak, and keep upgrading to conform to protocol upgrades, you could simply call a specific function, employ parachain feature, and launch.


Such a novel way of Web3 development significantly simplifies the go-to-market trajectory of your Web3 project. Plus, Apillon APIs are designed to be supported by any development framework and adapt to your working environment.


The Apillon Beta platform incorporates the following APIs:

[Web3 Storage service API](https://wiki.apillon.io/build/3-apillon-api.html#web3-storage-api)
[Web3 Hosting service API](https://wiki.apillon.io/build/3-apillon-api.html#web3-hosting-api)

In upcoming versions, more APIs for straightforward access to parachain services will be added.


Together with ample SDKs and documentation for faster and more streamlined integration of parachain features, Apillon APIs allow you to create fully functional Web3 products with lower error risk and less need for external auditing.
