### A quick walk through the Apillon dashboard and providedÂ features


#### Subtitle


After numerous upgrades and tweaks, the recently updated Apillon dashboard serves as a one-stop-shop for Web3 developers, offering a variety of integrated and ready-to-use decentralized services, features, and tools.


### Why newÂ UI?


By expanding Apillons Solutions Portfolio to several services, smart contracts and prebuilt solutions, we were faced with a predicament regarding our UI and correct service portfolio placement in it.


This drove us to re-evaluate our UI and do a facelift that brings further clarity to our user experience and provides flows that are generic enough to stand further expansion and the test of time.


Looking at the new, refreshed home screen, you can find that the main navigation was split into three main categories:


Letâ€™s check them one by one.


#### Web3 Services


Web3 services are intended for pure developers who are looking for a preconfigured Web3 service, which includes underlying payments, and fully functional usability over API, SDK and or CLI.


With Web3 services on Apillon, the idea is to build Web3 products from scratch, relying on wide options offered from Storage, Authentication, Compute, Social and other services coming in the future.


What started as a humble Web3 storage integration powered by Crust Network has been expanded to a potent and versatile group of networks, ready to be used by Apillon users. These include:

### Smart contracts


On the Smart contract part, Apillon offers deployment of secure, audited standard smart contracts on either Moonbeam or Astar. Once deployed, each smart contract is equipped with a matching subsquid so developer can rely on simple deployment and immediate integration of smart contract functionality via simple API.


Smart contracts are intended for developers who are looking to add blockchain functionality to Web3 services that are available on Apillon.


### Prebuilt solutions


These Apillon products are intended for businesses entering Web3, or developers who either lack the time or knowledge to configure everything manually. Open sourced in their nature, prebuilt solutions represent no-code solutions for 5 most common NFT use cases, sought out by smaller Web2 agencies, freelancers or businesses entering Web3, looking for specific use cases.


The instructions are simple: Find a prebuilt solution that matches your use case, deploy it simply by clicking and utilise the premade frontend templates to rebrand or redesign the visuals.


On the screenshot above, you can see each of these solutions deployed on the platform. Visual separation between each category of a product allows you to easily identify which services are used and deployed, allowing you to easily monitor what is going on with your project.

### Other tweaks andÂ updates


#### Payment provider


As a way to bring newbies to the Web3 space easily, the Apillon dashboard complemented the DOT payment option with fiat, allowing users to pay for services with their credit card, as SaaS products do.


#### Dashboard UI


As a nod to the variety of Apillon users, their skills and development methods, the Apillon dashboard provides different ways of harnessing the Web3 technology, all production-ready and accessible in a user-friendly way.
