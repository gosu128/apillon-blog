It’s been a wild ride for Apillon this year, packed with events, marketing milestones, and that sweet, sweet user growth.


2024 was the year we brought ideas to life both on and off the blockchain. From hosting local Polkadot events in Ljubljana to sharing Apillon’s vision at global summits, we made every moment(um) count. Add the hackathons, many partnerships, and campaigns that turned heads (and clicks), and you have a year to remember.


But before we dive into the details, let’s zoom out for the main highlights 🌟


### Intro: Stat wars, the data awakens


The numbers don’t lie — and we’re proud to say they’re looking pretty great. But behind every quirky metric is a story of growth, engagement, coffee and a little bit of chaos.


Let’s take a look at the year that brought both brilliance and bloopers to Apillon’s marketing Web3 journey.


#### More builders in the loop


This year, our newsletter community grew by 1054.65%, keeping developers, enthusiasts, and innovators updated on everything Apillon.


From exclusive updates on new features to behind-the-scenes looks at events and hackathons, our newsletter became the go-to source for staying connected. More subscribers meant a stronger network of builders, ready to explore, build, and create the Web3 future.


#### Views that count


In 2024, our website, platform and blog content reached almost 400,000 views, connecting with Web3 builders worldwide. Whether they came for tutorials, industry insights, or product deep dives, our content made an impact.


Some of our articles became your favorites (❤), proving that the right mix of education and inspiration keeps people returning. Every impression* wasn’t just a number but a step toward building trust in the Apillon ecosystem.


#### Apillon without borders


Apillon’s campaigns crossed borders and resonated with developers in 77 countries. Our message sparked interest, excitement, and curiosity from Asia to Europe and beyond.


Whether through targeted incentivization campaigns or global events, we’re connecting builders in ways that transcend geographic boundaries. The Web3 vision isn’t confined to one region, and neither is Apillon.


It wasn’t luck — it was hustle. From newsletters packed with insights to campaigns that spoke to developers everywhere, we focused on one thing: making Apillon the go-to for builders. Let’s break down the work we did this year.


### 1. Events we planned, paths we expanded


2024 had us running — from our beloved Ljubljana to conference stages worldwide. And no, not literally (okay, sometimes literally), but Apillon was everywhere the Web3 buzz be buzzing. We didn’t just show up; we showed off. Ideas were sparked, connections made, and more than a few lattes consumed along the way.


6 hometown Polkadot events: Ljubljana wasn’t just our base — it was our stage. From workshops to panel talks, we brought the Web3 vibe home, empowering local developers and connecting them to the global Polkadot ecosystem.

And we must have been very successful in preaching about Polkadot, because these numbers don’t lie 😉


8 global conferences and summits: Polkadot Decoded, Token 2049, and beyond — Apillon made waves in eight cities, sharing our vision and building bridges with Web3’s brightest minds.

These were events but at the same time they posed as launchpads for ideas, collaborations, and friendships. As we like to say, the Apillon team is always just one jetlag away from the next great conference.


### 2. Collabs we made, trust we laid


Building Web3 isn’t a solo gig. In 2024, we joined forces with incredible teams to create solutions that empower builders, simplify processes, and, honestly, just make Web3 cooler. And more simplified.

Collaboration was the name of the game, and together with our partners — including Encode Club, who joined us for hackathons — we amplified Apillon’s reach, ensuring that builders everywhere had access to tools designed with them in mind.


### 3. SEO wins, Google spins and Twitter pins


If SEO were a game, Apillon leveled up like a Tetris pro. People googled us as everything but our right name, even “the Web3 dev thingie,” but hey — they still found us! And what they found was a goldmine of content, ideas, and moments that kept builders coming back.


But let’s check out some of the deets on how we did with our reach:

#### Most-liked tweet


With almost 29K impressions the winner is our Embedded wallets post, proving that a little humor (and a lot of innovation) goes a long way.


#### Search highlights


Keywords you searched that led you to Apillon content, our webpage, or directly to the platform👇


Apparently, we’ve got the content you need and the answers you’re looking for — because you turned to us for Web3 innovation, landing us in Google’s top 3 for 10 keywords and Google’s top 10 for 24 keywords, wow!


And hey, we’re even more honored when you’re searching for us directly — even if “Apillon” sometimes gets a creative spelling twist. No offense taken.


It wasn’t just about being seen — it was about connecting. Content and a healthy dose of humor kept Apillon at the forefront of the Web3 conversation, no matter how you spelled it.


### 4. Strategies in motion, incentives with devotion


In late February, Apillon launched a bold initiative to connect builders with the building options of the Polkadot ecosystem. Through a strategic Airdrop campaign, developers were invited to test the platform, explore parachain features, and turn wild Web3 ideas into reality.


Actions speak louder than ads, so we put the power in developers hands. Builders completed a series of simple, hands-on tasks that demonstrated the full potential of Apillon’s services.


It’s proof that hands-on usage beats marketing every time.


And for the advanced builders? Buckle up — big incentives are on the way to fuel groundbreaking projects and bring Web3 tech into the real world where it belongs.


### 5. Hack by hack, breaking the stack


Hackathons are where Web3 ideas take flight (sometimes literally 🐦). In 2024, Apillon brought together developers for three high-energy events that turned ambitious ideas into dapps ready to make a real impact.

[Build on Polkadot: W3Transfer Educate series](https://www.encode.club/w3transfer-educate)

With Encode Club on board, we organized our very first hackathon, where participants were hacking the decentralized Wetransfer clone. The atmosphere was electric. Builders brainstormed, coded, and collaborated like their keyboards depended on it — fueled by creativity and, let’s be honest, way too much coffee.


The results? The unforgettable DegenPigeon — a quirky file-sharing masterpiece that proved Web3 can be equal parts functional and fun. Innovation thrived, and so did the community.

### 6. Product drops and demo crops


We definitely didn’t just talk the talk — we walked the Web3 walk, bringing developers hands-on guides, live demos, and game-changing product launches that made building in Web3 as smooth as a well-executed code commit. And also, made a splashing preview in the Web2 world, bam!


#### Product Hunt Launch


For the first time, Apillon firmly stepped beyond the Web3 bubble and landed in the Web2 spotlight. Our Embedded Wallets SDK didn’t just get noticed — it made waves, earning nearly 500 upvotes and proving that the appetite for blockchain solutions isn’t just within Web3.


The Web2 world is ready to start transitioning, and Apillon is bridging the gap. This wasn’t just a launch; it was validation that the demand for seamless, user-friendly blockchain tools is real — and growing.


#### Embedded Wallets promo video


And since Apillon’s Embedded wallets made Web3 onboarding so so simple, at least we could do was make a very cute demo that showcased how wallet-as-a-service transforms the user experience.


Developers saw firsthand how simple, secure, and seamless it is to integrate wallet functionality into their dapps. This wasn’t just a feature — it was a game-changer that is blurring the lines between Web2 ease and Web3 innovation.


### 2025, Apillon is coming


2024 was about building bridges — connecting builders, ideas, and the Web3 world. Apillon didn’t just navigate the space; it charted new paths.


But if you think 2024 was big, hold on to your keyboards. 2025 is coming, and we’re bringing bigger ideas, sharper tools, and unstoppable energy to the Web3 frontier. The mission is clear: simplify, empower, and innovate. Together, let’s make Web3 the default, not the exception.


Here’s to fresh ideas, bold moves, and a year of breaking barriers 🎄


And soon, we’ll conquer the world.
