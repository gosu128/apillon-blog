### Apillon Referral program — boosting Web3 adoption one developer at a time


#### The Web3 revolution is underway and needs strong advocators and a healthy community to back it up. Spreading the word about Apillon and engaging your Web3 connections can work wonders. You in?


In the light of providing much-needed tools for Web3 builders, Apillon launched the Closed Beta version of its Web3 development platform in the past month and is now releasing the Referral program to boost the platform’s adoption by spreading the word in exchange for rewards and eternal glory.

Lend a hand showing the Web3 sphere how straightforward building with Apillon is and get rewarded on the way!


### “Ask not what you can do for Apillon...”


We often say that there is no Web3 product without the community. Well, we mean it in both literal and figurative ways.


Literally, because the Apillon Web3 development platform is and will be built by the developers for developers to mitigate the endless and costly burden of blockchain project set-ups.

And figuratively, because the Apillon platform would not have been built with such passion were there not for Apillon’s community of early adopters.


By launching the Apillon Referral program, we would like to appeal to all the developers who are either struggling to enter the complex Web3 ecosystem or are looking to simplify their already-packed Web3 journey. The more people, the bigger the shoutout — the more established the Web3 sphere.


### “… but what Apillon can do for you.”


The Apillon Referral program is a part of the Web3 adoption strategy in the long run and will perpetually reward existing users for bringing more attention to the Apillon platform among their communities and peers.


Since Apillon is a Web3 development platform, the focus is set on developers. The program focuses on the quality of leads in the Web3 space and therefore rewards the users who will attract Web3 builders.


#### 1. The general mechanics and steps


The basis for entering the Apillon Referral program is to register an account on the Apillon platform. When you land on the platform’s dashboard, click Start your Referral journey button.

Clicking the button will lead you to a simple eligibility check — at this point, the program has limited reach so only EU-based users can receive rewards. Do not get discouraged, though — in the future, we plan to upgrade the Apillon Referral program with digital rewards, NFTs and or cryptocurrencies and the list of countries will get expanded as well.


Once you are settled in, you can start collecting referral points and eventually get rewarded with a merch pack or other rewards that are available at that moment.


As we want to follow the progress of the most proactive participants of the program since its inception, we’ve established two types of points. Each time you earn a point, both spending and experience (XP) points increase in number. Important:


#### 2. Collecting points


As of right now, there is a certain set of tasks you can perform in exchange for points, but there will be new tasks and new reward packs added to the program periodically, giving participants a chance to consistently collect points over a span of time. Your personal referral link will be active at all times and will not be limited by the number of referred users. The more, the merrier.


The Referral program dashboard is composed of two main views that you can switch between:

### The future


The Apillon Referral program is planned to be carried out as a marathon, not a sprint. As mentioned above, the XP points that describe the overall activity of each user will serve as a basis for future governance, NFT rewards and unlocking special achievements within the Apillon platform.


So, get on the Apillon Referral train, inspire other Web3 builders and attract kind spirits, reward yourself with Apillon memorabilia and become a part of the ever-growing Apillon community.
