### Highlights of Apillon and the Polkadot ecosystem‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäQ1¬†2023


#### Initial features and first adopters of the Apillon platform, Polkadot ecosystem growth, and parachains‚Äô support of Web2 businesses and¬†users.

[1. Apillon](#5808)
[2. Polkadot Ecosystem](#5e0c)

With Q1 of the year in the books, it‚Äôs time to retrospect what was cooking at Apillon and in the Polkadot corner of the Web3 space.


First, the not-so-new kit on the block, Apillon.


### 1. Apillon


The first months of the year were a real catalyst for Apillon, as the fruits of hard work months prior were brought to the public. Things started falling into place product-wise, and the team spread the word far and wide about improved ways to build the Web3 ecosystem.


In late January, the invitation-only Closed Beta of the Apillon platform launched, opening the gate to engineers seeking to onboard the Web3 train or accelerate their journey. Here is what else the team worked on, delivered, and expanded.

[Closed Beta](https://medium.com/apillon/apillon-launches-an-invitation-only-closed-beta-of-the-web3-development-platform-a075c38273a3)
[1.1 Platform integrations & Web3 services](#7fe0)
[1.2 Adoption](#5259)
[1.3 Features & Functionalities](#5c94)
[1.4 Events](#bfe0)
[1.5 Community](#5299)

#### 1.1 Platform integrations & Web3¬†services


The Apillon platform redefines the Web3 development experience by delivering easy access to the features of Polkadot parachains via drag-and-drop Web3 services and straightforward API calls.

[Web3 services](https://medium.com/apillon/apillon-platform-up-close-web3-services-f77530dd274e)
[API calls](https://medium.com/apillon/apillon-features-api-calls-to-web3-services-c99ab6379b03)

A modular approach allows users to create interoperable and cross-chain dapps from the get-go without having to dive deep into the technical characteristics and specifics of individual networks and protocols.

[interoperable and cross-chain dapps](https://medium.com/apillon/web3-adoption-polkadot-interoperability-cross-chain-dapps-c74c48a07bdc)

üîó In the Closed Beta stage, Apillon partnered with Crust Network to deliver Web3 Storage and Web3 Hosting services on the platform. The first case of implementing a Web3 service is the apillon.io website which has become unstoppable via decentralized hosting.

üîó Soon after, Apillon partnered with Phala Network to provide trustless and supremely efficient off-chain computing power. The integration of Phala to the Apillon platform is in the making and will be released soon.

#### 1.2 Adoption


The launch of the platform‚Äôs Closed Beta attracted quite a crowd.


Considering the facts that the entire concept had been conceived just a few months prior, that the Beta stage offers only a handful of initial features, and that the target audience of software and web engineers is very niche, the stats are more than encouraging and demonstrate the need for Apillon‚Äôs presence on the market.


üìä Total Beta users on the platform: 506


üìä New users per day on average: 5.6


User engagement drew a similar skyline: developer activities surged in mid-January with over 1,300 server requests, just around the time the Apillon Ambassador Program launched and the highly anticipated Closed Beta saw the light of day.

[Apillon Ambassador Program](https://medium.com/apillon/ready-set-go-apillon-ambassador-program-in-full-swing-676fd10aea45)
[Closed Beta](https://blog.apillon.io/apillon-launches-an-invitation-only-closed-beta-of-the-web3-development-platform-a075c38273a3)

A couple more spikes lined up in early February following important partnership announcements and the team‚Äôs notable presence at key industry events. Since then, developer activity has frequently generated over 200, 300 server requests per day.

#### 1.3 Features & Functionalities


Apart from the built-in capabilities of the Apillon platform at launch, additional features were gradually rolled out to enhance the Web3 development experience and give more power to the builders‚Äô community.


üîë IPFS & IPNS connectivity delivers the option to store and host website and app data in a decentralized manner while retaining its editability.

[IPFS & IPNS connectivity](https://medium.com/apillon/the-third-edition-of-polkadot-meetup-ljubljana-sets-the-bar-high-9c6ea32b7f5f)

üîë Polkadot wallet login supports one-click entry to Apillon user‚Äôs account via Polkadot.js, SubWallet, or Talisman wallet. The option to register an Apillon account in a fully Web3 manner using digital wallets will be made available in future versions.

[Polkadot wallet login](https://medium.com/apillon/apillon-feature-polkadot-wallet-login-d50c2128e8ed)

üîë Apillon Governance model was published to demonstrate how builders can participate in the expansion of the Web3 ecosystem, perfect the development experience and co-design the Apillon platform through decentralized decision-making and weighted voting.

#### 1.4 Events


Spreading the word beyond online spaces, the team showcased the platform and left a mark from high-ranked Web3 events to smaller gatherings of Web3 enthusiasts.


üìç The third edition of Polkadot Meetup Ljubljana delivered a first-hand presentation of Apillon‚Äôs work by CEO Matja≈æ Soboƒçan and a demo of the platform‚Äôs Closed Beta by CMO Nino Kutnjak. Together with Valery Gantchev of HydraDX and Rust developer Stanko Krstiƒç, the team served deep insight into advanced ways of building Web3 solutions.

üìç At Paris Blockchain Week, the leading Web3 event on European soil in March, the team reiterated the role of improved UX in Web3 adoption‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa common thread of the event and a proof that Apillon solves a real and pertinent issue of the ecosystem.

#### 1.5 Community


The Apillon platform serves a niche community of Web2-turned-Web3 developers, but it can only do so much on its own. To establish a strong position in the ecosystem, it takes more than a solid product‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit takes a village.


Pursuing the goal of educating and giving a hand to everyone climbing the wall of Web3, Apillon released a few community-building incentives.


üì¢ Ambassador program aims to accelerate the adoption of the platform and Web3 technologies through various contribution tiers,

[Ambassador program](https://medium.com/apillon/ready-set-go-apillon-ambassador-program-in-full-swing-676fd10aea45)

üì¢ Referral program rewards individuals for spreading the word of Apillon in the developer and Web3 communities,

[Referral program](https://medium.com/apillon/apillon-referral-program-boosting-web3-adoption-one-developer-at-a-time-d0e67b449ef0)

üì¢ And, answers to 10 burning questions about Apillon clear any doubts about the platform, its objectives, functionalities, and goals.

### 2. Polkadot ecosystem


Regardless of the market sentiment, the Web3 space keeps building, and the Polkadot ecosystem is one of the most active. Together with its parachains, the network has delivered plenty in terms of development activities and real-life use.

[2.2 Crust Network](#e393)
[2.3 KILT Protocol](#8149)
[2.4 Moonbeam Network](#2145)
[2.5 Phala Network](#585f)
[2.6 Other](#49c6)

#### 2.1 Polkadot

[Polkadot Network](https://polkadot.network/)

After an impressive QoQ growth in 2022 and a massive spike in mid-December, the Polkadot Relay Chain continues the path of steady growth with thousands of newly created accounts every day.


The Cross-Consensus Message Format (XCM) is a complex language system that allows parachains to exchange messages with one another, the Relay Chain, and even outside the Polkadot ecosystem. The next version of XCM, XCM V3, will launch soon and deliver improved programmability, bridging to external networks, NFTs, and more.

[Cross-Consensus Message Format (XCM)](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-crosschain)
[XCM V3](https://polkadot.network/blog/xcm-v3-breaking-new-ground-for-web3-interoperability/)

The expansion of XCM is one of the key elements of Polkadot‚Äôs continued growth, and strong XCM activity demonstrates ecosystem vigor and the importance of interoperability in Polkadot-based apps.
