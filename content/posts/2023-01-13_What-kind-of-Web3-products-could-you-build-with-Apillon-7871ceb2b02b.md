### What kind of Web3 products could you build with Apillon


#### Web3 has the potential to disrupt any industry, and once the developers learn about its possibilities and applications, the development part becomes much easier.

The technologies, protocols, and frameworks that power the Web3 space have led to the creation of wholly new industries and environments, such as DeFi, Metaverse, and NFT gaming. But they could just as significantly redefine established structures in businesses, organizations, and online social interactions.


Once the developers get an idea of how they could use Web3 to their advantage, the opportunities for the products they build are endless.


Here’s what you can create by implementing Web3 technologies, and improve the way your products work and how their users interact with them.


### How do Web3 products differ from Web2 ones?


It all stems from the decentralized approach to handling and exchanging data and assets. Web3 flattens out the currently centralized pyramids of data and value exchange sustained by the big tech corporations.


It redefines and improves the way users own, share, and manage digital data and assets, and how they interact with the digital environment.


Some of the main differences between Web2 and Web3 products are:


Building a Web3 product does not mean the final result should be built on decentralized technologies from the first to the last line of code. In fact, there are only a handful of such solutions.


But by tweaking just a feature or two using Web3 technologies, any app, program, or website could take advantage of better security options, higher privacy, faster execution, and greater transparency. Such Web3 products would give users more control and agency in the way they engage with them while optimizing the core infrastructure for improved command processing.


### What kinds of products could you create with Apillon?


The Apillon platform is designed to gather and deliver a range of Web3 services for developers building new digital solutions or upgrading existing ones.


The inaugural version of Apillon, the soon-to-be-released Closed Beta, will support some of the crucial Web3 services provided by Polkadot parachains:

[Closed Beta](https://app.apillon.io/register)
[KILT Protocol](https://www.kilt.io/)
[Crust Network](https://crust.network/)
[Phala Network](https://www.phala.network/en/)

Here is how you could employ them to create or improve your Web3 app.


#### Web3 Authentication use cases


With Web3 Authentication service, you could integrate decentralized verification of identities, assets, and data through claims and attestations provided by the KILT Protocol.

[KILT Protocol](https://www.kilt.io)

Your app’s users would be able to verify specific attributes of a person, object, or file. This is particularly useful in products that incorporate digital identities and require log-ins or include digital certification, provenance check, and verification of data or assets.


You could thus implement Web3 Authentication to onboard users to your app through a Web3, self-sovereign digital identity, either as a sole option or together with standard Web2 options, such as email or social log-in.


Or, you could use it to prove a certain quality of your product, such as compliance with sustainable production standards, etc. Such credentials could be digitally attached to a tangible item and transparently verifiable by customers on the blockchain.


With KILT’s interoperable Web3 authentication protocol accessible on the Apillon platform, you can introduce blockchain-based user and asset verification and certification to your app and combine it with other Web3 services, further expanding its utilities for end-users.


#### Web3 Storage use cases


With Apillon’s Web3 Storage service, you gain access to distributed cloud storage, powered by IPFS and Crust Network, for distributed and more secure hosting.

[Crust Network](https://crust.network/)

Through the Apillon Platform API, you could simply deploy your app or website on IPFS network, and ensure it’s distributed across the global web of storage servers via Crust Network. As multiple nodes store your app’s or website’s files, it becomes more easily reachable and defies single-point failures.


If you decide to create a blockchain-based social platform or an app that involves huge amounts of user data, such as an NFT marketplace, Crust/IPFS Network also gives way to general off-chain data storage service. This is particularly useful in the NFT arena, where you could build apps that support advanced features, such as NFT-based synthetic assets, lending and borrowing collateralized with NFTs, and buy-now-pay-later NFTs.

[Why decentralized storage matters for NFT metadata and your next NFT collectionInstead of overdoing what meets the eye, NFT projects should focus more on metadata and its storage to keep it…blog.apillon.io](https://blog.apillon.io/why-decentralized-storage-matters-for-nft-metadata-and-your-next-nft-collection-b7b90fc3762)

Or, if you want to build P2P content delivery network (CDN) services, you can do so easily and faster with Crust Network. It incentivizes the nodes to distribute data and serve as CDN edge nodes, which accelerates data transmission and improves the experience for your app’s users.


Your app could even harness secured cloud storage without having to maintain storage clusters. Simply integrate Crust/IPFS’s SDK and give your app’s users access to stable storage services.


#### Web3 Computing use cases


With Web3 Computing services powered by Phala Network, a distributed, secure, and serverless cloud computing solution, you could create a myriad of applications where private, trusted, and verifiably correct computations back every action.

[Phala Network](https://www.phala.network/en/)

Phala Network, a blockchain-based computation protocol, guarantees the security of the compute load and delivers correct program execution, confidentiality, and privacy. With scalable, cross-chain compute services enhanced with privacy protection, it redefines the way apps harness cloud computing power.


Most often, Phala’s decentralized computing infrastructure has powered innovative metaverses and NFT apps. You, too, could build apps, games, or NFT marketplaces with additional privacy features and secret messages. You could even integrate Phala to build Web3 NFT rendering farms, Web3 game servers, game engines, etc.


With the introduction of Phala’s Phat Contract, the opportunities will expand even further. You could use one contract to build decentralized oracles, for example, Twitter monitor, cross-chain data feed, on-chain price feed, etc. Or, to improve your app’s smart contracts, you could implement data attestation service. Perhaps, you’re in need of personal storage or a secret store, and transaction tagging on a blockchain explorer — you could do that, too.


Also, if your app is mostly Web2-based, but you’d like to enhance it with Web3 computing power, you could merge the two sides, for example, by building a push notification service to social media and mobile apps, a decentralized 2FA, or a password manager. Maybe your app needs to process large amounts of IoT data, and you could implement trusted IoT data processes. Or, in case your website should improve its performance, you could even host its front-end on a decentralized infrastructure.


Web3 Computing service goes even beyond that. Combined with decentralized smart contracts, storage protocols, and data indexing services, it will give way to developing highly versatile and powerful Web3 applications.


### Build a better web


Be it metaverse, NFTs, blockchain gaming, DeFi, or just your good-old Web2 app that needs an update, Apillon allows you to build the next big Web3 thing or bring the existing solutions to the next level.

Remember, it doesn’t have to be based on a decentralized infrastructure end-to-end to be worthy of a Web3 label. By tweaking just the thing that now hurts or could be improved, you could create a whole new, or advanced, Web3 product.


With Apillon, decentralized storage, hosting, and computing options are just a click away. Create your account, get familiar with the possibilities of streamlined Web3 development, and stay tuned for the launch of Apillon Closed Beta.
