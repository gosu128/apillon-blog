### The challenges of building on Web3


#### The journey of building decentralized applications from start to finish is an uphill struggle, packed with wrong turns, dead ends, and misconceptions.


The amount of data and metadata that needs processing in the modern world is inconceivable. Strong demand for streamlining the process and moving away from central data ownership has been building up. Web2 services and tools have been a great transition from a physical world to all things digital. However, every era eventually advances to the next stage.


Web3 disrupted the current state of doing business and laid an excellent foundation for building a decentralized future. But it didn’t come without challenges and the transition to the new way of exchanging information is still a struggle for many.


### A long and rocky road to success


The count of Web3 developers has been growing exponentially; even so, their community still represents a relatively small percentage of all software engineers. Why is adopting and building on blockchain still a tough nut to crack?


Every developer team’s focal point is to create and deploy something unique and practical for the end-users. Be it in corporate IT departments, in small-scale startups, or as freelance developers — blockchain can provide them with many great benefits.


Nevertheless, it is still quite a murky sea to sail — it is not that difficult as it is different. The essential layers of blockchain are there, but the lack of additional architecture to build on makes it hard for the developers to progress fast.


### Don’t think Web2 when building Web3


Compared to Web2 services, where there’s a plethora of managed services offering plug-and-play APIs for developers, Web3 builders are bound to do more work to even get to point zero.


Imagine being a Web3 builder — you’d have to build yourself the whole infrastructure around the core blockchain node before even getting to the good part — start working on a dapp or product with a unique value for end-users.


What does that mean for a company employing Web3 builders and investing in an upgrade to blockchain-based business operations?


### Web3 builder’s toolkit as a service


Sure, the traditional Web2 coding skills like JavaScript, C++, Python, etc., are not a totally lost art in Web3. Yet due to the total change of paradigm and pending maturity of its infrastructure, blockchain-based building requires a complete shift of the mindset and proficiency.


The high technical barrier to using Web3 is the main reason blockchain adoption is lagging.


How to get more Web3 developers to create dapps, products, and services of the future and more enterprises to start benefiting from blockchain technology in general? By providing the elementary building blocks with easy-to-use and mix-and-match APIs and plug-ins.


We are on the verge of tapping into the great potential of blockchain-based technologies and getting the ball rolling on the mass adoption of Web3-adjacent solutions. At Authtrail, our mission is to bring blockchain closer to Web3 developers by building an easier on-ramp to different protocol layers. Supporting the builders of the new-era internet will help capitalize on the countless opportunities the blockchain technology provides, for business, personal and P2P use.
