At Apillon, we’re all about making decentralized infrastructure less of a puzzle and more of a toolkit. And that’s why we’re adding a second option for decentralized storage on the Apillon platform.


With CESS Network joining the mix, builders will soon have an alternative for encrypted and dynamic data storage — right alongside IPFS.

So, what’s in it for you? Smoother builds, less duct tape encryption, and more confidence when shipping dapps.


### Why we’re partnering with CESS


Apillon’s mission has always been to offer builders practical tools without locking them into a single way of doing things. By first launching our Web3 storage service, we integrated IPFS, powered by CRUST, which is a great fit for storing public data — such as NFT metadata, public assets, and openly accessible content.


By partnering with CESS Network, we’re extending the storage functionality. CESS will introduce a new option for developers who require encrypted data storage or are working with dynamic, high-frequency data.

CESS will sit alongside IPFS, giving builders more flexibility to choose the right tool for the right use case.


Whether your data is meant to be public or needs to be encrypted, Apillon will soon let you decide — all within the same familiar workflow.


### What’s coming for builders


Once the integration is live, you’ll get the best of both worlds in one workflow. Store public data on IPFS via CRUST. Store sensitive or encrypted data on CESS. No extra hoops, no extra tools, just a simple choice when you upload.


The two options will work side by side, so you can build dapps that combine transparency where needed and privacy where required.


As for pricing, details will become clearer once CESS storage is available in production. We’ll share specifics closer to the launch so you can plan accordingly.


### Looking ahead


This is a big step toward making Apillon the Web3 storage Swiss army knife. One platform, two protocols, full flexibility.


The work is already underway — we’ll keep you posted as we move toward making it available on the platform.
