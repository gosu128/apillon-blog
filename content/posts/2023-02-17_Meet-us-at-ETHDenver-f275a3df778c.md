### Meet us at ETHDenver


#### Apillon presents its Web3 development platform alongside other key Polkadot ecosystem teams at ETHDenver 2023.


This year, the core Apillon team will attend the world’s largest and longest-running ETH event for the second time. If last year was all about connecting with other top Web3 players, this year, we‘re thrilled to officially showcase the Apillon platform alongside the biggest projects in the Polkadot ecosystem.


### Who’s coming and why


Bringing together a diverse community of developers, designers, builders, coders, thinkers, and other key players that are shaping a Web3 future, ETHDenver has established itself as one of the year’s most important events for the makers and shakers of a decentralized future.


The fastest-growing blockchain that lays the foundation for Web3 building, Polkadot Network, will set up the official Polkadot booth at ETHDenver 2023. It’s expected to host the most promising ecosystem projects that are contributing to a multichain decentralized future. Besides, the Polkadot collaborative community is organizing exciting side events, full of rich content.

### Apillon‘s packed schedule


This year, ETHDenver will take place from February 24 to March 5 at various locations in the RiNo Art District.


Apillon’s agenda at the 2023 ETHDenver edition is looking tight as the team will participate in numerous panels and showcase the Apillon Web3 development platform next to other groundbreaking decentralized projects at various platforms.


First, Apillon will begin its Denver run with a panel at Polkadot’s mini-summit, BUIDLing the multichain, which will deliver a day of talks to bring together builders that are pushing the boundaries of Web3.

As Polkadot will host the most groundbreaking projects from the ecosystem at its official booth, Apillon will be right up there with the most promising teams. At the Polkadot booth, anybody interested in a decentralized multichain future will have the opportunity to discover the Apillon Web3 development platform for BUIDLers at the booth and discuss all things Web3 with the Apillon team.


A decentralized smart contract platform, Moonbeam Network has also invited the Apillon team to the Moonbeam booth to demonstrate how the Apillon platform can ease the development of decentralized projects.

Besides presenting the Apillon platform at the most exciting ETHDenver core events, Apillon is proud to co-organize the highly-anticipated side event Polkadot in USe together with other Polkadot ecosystem teams. This mini-conference will offer an afternoon full of insights into practical use cases built on the Polkadot blockchain.
