Whether youâ€™re sharing large files with your team, collaborating across continents or sending family photos to your mother-in-law, DegenPigeon offers a seamless experience without the limitations of centralized platforms.


### Why choose DegenPigeon?


Traditional file-sharing platforms like WeTransfer may be convenient, but they come with centralized baggage: data vulnerability, reliance on single servers, and the constant risk of downtime.


When uploading files using DegenPigeon, the files are split into pieces and distributed across randomly selected nodes in the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). Sounds spacey? It is and itâ€™s awesome! ðŸŒŽ âœ¨

#### 2. Uploading files


You can upload your files or drag and drop them into the field. The files will be distributed globally, ensuring unstoppability and privacy.


#### 3. Email sharing, reimagined

### From hackathon dream to Web3Â reality


DegenPigeonâ€™s journey began at an Apillon Hackathon hosted in collaboration with Encode Club. The challenge? Build a decentralized alternative to WeTransferâ€Šâ€”â€Ša tool that combines Web2 simplicity with Web3 innovation.


The goal was to showcase how Web3 products can be intuitive and practical, breaking the stereotype of being overly complex. Originally dubbed W3transfer, DegenPigeon was the winning solution, standing out for its clean design and alignment with Web3 values.
