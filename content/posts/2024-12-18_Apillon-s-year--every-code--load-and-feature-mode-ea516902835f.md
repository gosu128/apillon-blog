2024 was the most prolific and successful for Apillon so far. From coffee-fueled brainstorms to whiteboards that became murals of genius, the team pushed boundaries and delivered on milestones that turned heads across the Web3 space.


It was all about igniting activity across the Polkadot ecosystem. A great number of users interacted with Polkadot parachains, services, and features through Apillon, transforming the network into a hub of developer experimentation and real-world application.


Now, let’s count our Web3 blessings one by one.


### Intro: The numbers speak volumes


Before diving into the nitty-gritty of our 2024 highlights, let’s take a step back and admire the bigger picture — the numbers that turned heads, fueled ecosystems and proved Apillon is a staying power in the Web3 space.


Let’s see what growth looks like when innovation meets action ✨


From 1,370 users in 2023 to a jaw-dropping 10x more users in 2024, we didn’t just scale — we surged. Our incentivization campaigns pulled developers from all corners of the Web3 world, while the launch of $NCTR brought new energy to the platform.


And it wasn’t just quantity; it was quality too. With user retention rates climbing, we saw builders stick around, explore, and create. Apillon became their trusted sandbox.


This year, the project number skyrocketed to 109,405 projects. This wasn’t just random growth — it was intentional. Hackathons, developer outreach, and a robust suite of Web3 tools like Simplets and cloud functions gave creators everything they needed to succeed.


From indie developers launching personal projects to companies building enterprise-grade dapps, Apillon became the go-to platform for “idea to deployment.”


And how about that — the seed of 8,704 blockchain transactions in 2023 matured into the mindblowing number of 280,885 transactions in 2024. What’s driving this surge? Tools like Embedded wallets, Asset hub, NFTs and RPC services make blockchain interactions seamless.


Every transaction tells a story of someone building, minting, or deploying on Apillon. Moreover, these actions amplified activity across chains, showcasing the ripple effect of a platform truly integrated with the Web3 ecosystem.


#### How we got here


This growth was a mix of bold moves and a relentless drive to make Web3 development intuitive:


And now, the breakdown.


### 1. Services we launched, bugs we squashed


We hit “deploy” on some of our most ambitious tech projects yet. Every keystroke and debug session got us closer to Apillon’s mission of providing a more streamlined way of building Web3 products.


In 2023, the Apillon dashboard was packed with 4 essential Web3 services — a strong start, no doubt. Now? Well, there’s so many services, it scrolls 😉


Each new feature wasn’t just about adding more — it was about making Apillon’s ecosystem robust and more developer-friendly, equipping creators to focus on innovation rather than infrastructure with these services:


👉 Embedded Wallets, powered by Oasis: The Web3 onboarding headache? Gone. Embedded wallets make access seamless for both developers and users, blending Web2 ease with Web3 security.


👉 Asset hub: No code, no fuss. A streamlined wizard for asset creation and management, ensuring everything from symbols to IDs gets validated in minutes.


👉 RPC Service, powered by Dwellir: Scalable, reliable, and ready to go. Apillon’s RPC service ensures developers have smooth, uninterrupted access to blockchain data — no extra providers needed.


👉 Indexing Service, powered by SQD Network: Forget searching through haystacks. Indexing Service simplifies blockchain data retrieval, saving developers time and sanity.


👉 Web3 Cloud functions, powered by Acurast: Backend on autopilot. Deploy scripts, run logic, and let Apillon handle the heavy lifting in a decentralized way. Node.js in Web3? Yes, please.


👉 An array of Custom Smart Contracts: From generic deployments to tailored tweaks, developers can design and deploy contracts that fit any use case — no cookie-cutter limits here.


👉 Simplets: Need speed? Our 7 prebuilt, Docker-based NFT-powered solutions (backed by Web3 frameworks like Next.js and React.js) fast-track app development so you can go from idea to live in record time.


👉 Web3 Social, powered by Subsocial: Building communities, decentralized and unstoppable. Whether it’s hubs, posts, or engagement, Web3 Social empowers creators to connect on-chain.


As our integrations stack up, we revamped the Apillon dashboard — streamlining workflows for quicker navigation and smoother building. Now, everything’s organized into three main pillars:


### 2. A year of action, powered by traction


We didn’t just build — we scaled. Apillon’s services weren’t just tools; they became launchpads for action. Every click, upload, and deploy tells the story of a platform that’s empowering builders to create, grow, and push boundaries across the Web3 ecosystem.


Here’s what scaling looks like 👇


Over 946K files uploaded show growing trust in Web3 Storage, while 1,115 production-ready websites highlight how Apillon’s Web3 Hosting is powering real-world, functional projects.


With 34,660 NFTs on Moonbase, 5,831 on Moonbeam, 1,509 on Astar, and 32 on Unique, creators use the right chains for the right goals. Whether it’s speed, cost-efficiency, or functionality, Apillon is helping developers find their perfect blockchain match.


And those brand-new services? Indexing, RPC, and Embedded Wallets, launched just last month, already boast 19 indexers, 49 RPC keys, and 81 wallets activated. Talk about a strong start.


From file uploads to smart contract deployments, these milestones prove that the community is building and thriving: Web3 is scaling, and Apillon is leading the way.


### 3. Features enhanced, UX advanced


We didn’t just work on adding services — we focused on making them easier to use. From simplifying payments to refining workflows, every improvement was about creating a smoother, more intuitive experience for developers and users alike.


#### DOT on the spot


We didn’t just polish the edges — we streamlined the core. In March, we introduced DOT payments for purchasing credits and subscription plans, adding to our existing fiat payment options.


With a unified pricing structure, we made sure clarity and simplicity took center stage — no more holding each and every native token of the parachains you were using!

[$DOT payments now fully supported on the Apillon platformApillon integrates NOWpayments to offer a seamless $DOT payment option on their Web3 development platform.blog.apillon.io](https://blog.apillon.io/dot-payments-now-fully-supported-on-the-apillon-platform-7d9293f4104a)

#### IPFS URL Shortener


Our Storage and Hosting services have always been top-tier, but those long, clunky IPFS links weren’t exactly winning popularity contests. So, we built a URL shortener right into the platform.


Now, you can share files stored in decentralized storage with sleek, Web2-style links that are practical, clean, and ready to share.


Easy, decentralized, and oh-so-shareable 🏄


#### EVM wallet login


In addition to the already available Polkadot wallet connectivity, Apillon now supports profile entry using two major EVM wallets — MetaMask and Coinbase Wallet.


Logging into Web3 just got easier. No extra steps, no friction — just a smooth, secure way to dive straight into building, storing, and deploying on Web3.

### 4. Community-lead, governance ahead


#### Native $NCTR token


In 2024, Apillon dropped its most significant milestone yet — the launch of $NCTR, our native governance token. The Token Generation Event (TGE) on May 29 this year minted 150 million tokens on AssetHub, setting the stage for something truly game-changing.

$NCTR isn’t just a token; it’s the heartbeat of Apillon’s ecosystem. It provides token holders a seat at the table to vote on the platform’s future moves, it rewards the go-getters and builders driving Web3 adoption and it simplifies transactions for Apillon’s services, bridging fiat and crypto like a pro. What’s not to like?


And the cherry on top? $NCTR hit the big leagues with listings on tier-one CEX MEXC and two DEXs, StellaSwap and Hydration. Whether you’re trading or building, $NCTR is everywhere you need it to be.

#### Governance token be governing


By putting trust back in the hands of the builders and curators, Apillon can be shaped into a platform truly built for and by its community.


The launch of $NCTR marked a pivotal moment also in how we engage with our community of developers and users. It’s streamlined and sharp, it’s decentralized and transparent. In a nutshell, it’s user-driven.
