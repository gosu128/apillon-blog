### Apillon‚Äôs contribution to the Polkadot ecosystem transcends numbers


#### The stats are eye-popping but not surprising. It all stems from a strategic funnel and the core mission to boost the network‚Äôs adoption.


First, we‚Äôre just going to leave this here. üëá


Now, let‚Äôs break it down.


After a somewhat steady pace of two- to three-digit average daily user growth at the turn of the year, the Apillon gates opened wide, and tens of thousands of Web3 enthusiasts found their way to the platform in early March.


Ever since, thousands more have entered through the Apillon portal every day, piling up projects they have experimented with and/or deployed to production in decentralized fashion.


The after-spike period has taken a more steady turn and has consolidated into tens of thousands of daily server requests on the Apillon platform.


#### User breakdown


In total, the Apillon platform has become home to 114,156 builders from all walks of web life, with 73% of their projects (over 83,000) launched on the platform‚Äôs Freemium plan.


This demonstrates the plan‚Äôs versatility and sufficiency for early adopters of Web3 and Polkadot technologies, which was Apillon‚Äôs primary objective since the inception of the platform‚Äôs payment system.

To top off the free use of Web3 technologies, they also purchased over 350,000 Apillon credits, and used them in a myriad of ways, from decentralized storage and hosting to one-click-deploy prebuilt solutions.

With dozens of features now offered on the dashboard, stemming from tireless work in the past few months, Apillon is becoming a comprehensive, one-stop shop for Web3 builders.

#### Service & feature breakdown


As of late April 2024, the Apillon platform has generated the following stats linked to services and features offered:


üëâ Web3 Storage: 265,181 files uploadedüëâ Web3 Hosting: 27,571 web pages, 504 pushed to productionüëâ Bandwidth: 278 GB on Web3 Storage and Hostingüëâ NFT collections: 20,324 (Moonbeam 4,666; Moonbase 15,021; Astar 629)üëâ KILT DIDs: 784üëâ SubSocial hubs: 12,523üëâ API calls: 9,076,668üëâ Phala contracts: 447


When Apillon flaps its wings, it can be felt on the other side of Web3.


### How we got¬†here


If anything, it was not by chance or luck.


The spike on the charts above is there for a reason. In late February, Apillon launched a strategic initiative for the builders‚Äô community to test the platform and implement Polkadot parachains, features, and services into their projects.

Thousands saw the opportunity and grasped it. The very architecture of the Apillon platform is designed to funnel in different-purpose parachain technologies and deliver them in an easy-to-use format. So, for every crazy Web3 idea that had been waiting to happen, Apillon helped it become a reality.


But the main takeaway is this. Thousands of actions on Apillon translate to thousands of actions on the Polkadot chain. Such promotion of the Polkadot ecosystem directly helps decentralized technologies to transcend the confines of Web3 and become adopted by everyday netizens.


#### The funnel


When demonstrating the advantages and possibilities of a product, hands-on usage beats marketing efforts any day.


Through a series of simple tasks, builders of all backgrounds were taken on a journey through Apillon features, prebuilt solutions, and decentralized services on Polkadot.


This not only fast-tracked their Web3 project launches through connected parachain services. As they got familiar with the offering and intuitive user flow, many have turned from inspired first-time users to vocal advocates for the platform and supplied technologies.


These measurable, goal-oriented tasks ranged from basic file upload on the decentralized IPFS network via Crust to launching a standalone and self-sovereign NFT collection using multiple parachains, tools and templates provided.


Task variety was intentional and embodied Apillon‚Äôs core mission‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääto boost Web3 adoption through simplified building. Certain actions could therefore be executed by complete newbies, while others catered to mature programmers and gave room for more back-end tweaking.


The IPFS data chart paints a clear enough picture, too. With multiple gigabytes of data transferred daily to IPFS, Apillon users have evidently committed to completing the suggested tasks‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääor at least experimented around.


#### No two¬†alike


The funnel was designed to bring in as much traffic and as many masterminds as possible to the platform. With tens of thousands of projects now built on the Apillon platform, the goal was definitely achieved. In terms of expertise, users range from true beginners with no background in decentralized technologies who leveraged no-code and low-code solutions to seasoned developers who fast-tracked their production process with APIs, SDKs, and CLIs.


The platform‚Äôs interface delivers seamless interaction and implementation of decentralized features, while services can be purposefully reused in a myriad of use cases. The results that Apillon users have brought to life so far demonstrate just that. The sky is the limit.


Projects that blasted off the Apillon platform are as diverse as their creators. Fully functional decentralized websites and blogs. New Web3 startups on Solana, Ethereum and Polkadot. Pages hosted via Apillon Web3 Hosting testing out the offered functionalities but yet to be pushed beyond its ‚ÄúLorem Ipsum‚Äù status to production. Thousands of NFT collections deployed on either testnet or mainnet, demonstrating the full-circle capabilities of the NFT Service on Apillon. And everything in between.


At this point, the projects‚Äô production readiness‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääor lack thereof‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääis not a key factor. The primary goal of the Apillon adoption funnel was achieved.


‚ßì Tens of thousands of users were given an intuitive and effective means to tap into the Polkadot pool of decentralized building possibilities.


‚ßì All those leads will further be nurtured through education and guidance to upgrade their Web3 endeavors to a production level.


‚ßì Comprehensive incentivization programs would be released to foster the community of advanced developers building cutting-edge projects to enhance the real-world adoption of Polkadot technologies.


### Next stop: Self-sustainability


Apillon‚Äôs community-oriented campaign brought in heaps of development activity to the Polkadot space, with over 110,000 users having interacted with the ecosystem‚Äôs parachains, services, and features.


However, the Apillon platform is more than just a lab for Web3 experiments. It aims to evolve into a self-sustainable SaaS product and bring Polkadot technologies to the mainstream development level. On this note, stronger incentives will be put in place to convert a percentage of the current experimenters to paid users, expanding the capabilities and reach of their Web3 projects.


### Connecting the¬†dots


In the past few months, the Apillon platform has become a legitimate catalyst for Web3 and Polkadot adoption among laypeople and seasoned builders.


With Apillon, the Polkadot network has accumulated hundreds of thousands of actions that would possibly never have happened otherwise or would be subject to greater friction and resource investment.


But there‚Äôs still so much room for growth.


Join us in the next phase as we help builders to amplify their current achievements and distill Polkadot capabilities into real-world solutions ready for widespread adoption.


### ‚ßì About¬†Apillon
