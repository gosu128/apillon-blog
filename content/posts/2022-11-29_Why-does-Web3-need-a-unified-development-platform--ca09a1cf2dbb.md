### Why does Web3 need a unified development platform?


#### Web3 ecosystem has brought about an array of fantastic blockchain-based solutions for niche use cases. However, to boost their adoption and make them accessible to every developer, Web3 needs a common buildingÂ ground.


### The current state of Web3 development


The rise of open-source and decentralized technologies has led to the creation of systems that empower online users to exchange assets and data without relying on centralized authorities to enable or authorize the process.


However, even though the pace of technological progress has been swift, the adoption of decentralized solutions still awaits broad implementation in the real economy and among the mass user base.


Polkadot, one of the leading players in the Web3 ecosystem, is transforming the way blockchain technology powers new applications and makes them interoperable.

However, several factors still hinder the broader adoption of Web3 solutions:


If Web3 is indeed to become mainstream, there should be a better way of approaching it and building products using the latest technologies.


### Apillon redefines how Web3 products areÂ built


The philosophy of Web3 delivers a different take on the way users exchange data and assets with peers and businesses online, and introduces means of verified ownership to online interactions.


But for Web3 space to be built and developed to its full potential, it should first get on the same terms with whatâ€™s already thereâ€Šâ€”â€Šmillions of web developers familiar with just the standard web and software development languages.


Apillon bridges the gap between the developers who grew up with Web2 and the decentralized technologies powering Web3 digital products.


True to the main features of the Polkadot ecosystem, the Apillon platform changes the way Web3 is built with:

#### Access to multiple parachains, pallets, and smart contracts


Each Apillon-supported Web3 service is optimized for a specific use case, allowing developers to tap into more possibilities for innovation and specialization for their projects.


#### Scalability


Based on the Polkadot infrastructure, projects built with Apillon can process multiple transactions in parallel. The bottlenecks of earlier blockchain networks are removed, allowing developers to build scalable Web3 products that meet growing market demand.


#### Upgradeability


Thanks to Apillonâ€™s forkless upgrades to Polkadot parachains, developers can create projects that will remain agile, adaptable, and evolve in pace with technology.


#### Transparent governance


Through its governance utility, Apillonâ€™s NCTR token holders will be able to propose upgrades to the platform, perfect its features, and fortify their involvement in the evolution of the Web3 space.


#### Cross-chain composability


Thanks to Polkadotâ€™s Cross-Chain Messaging (XCM) system, developers can communicate, exchange value, and share functionality between chains. They can also interact with other decentralized protocols and external networks like Cosmos and Ethereum, further expanding the functionalities and adaptability of their Web3 products.


### One spot for Web3Â services


The Polkadot ecosystem is one of the fastest growing ecosystems, with new parachains and solutions developed weekly.


However, while each Polkadot parachain is best at solving isolated use cases, they only share a common ground at the underlying infrastructure level, but not necessarily in terms of accessibility, since they each come with unique sets of rules and best practices.


The Apillon platform is designed to operate as a unified point of access to Polkadot parachainâ€™s services. It connects and curates parachains, protocols, and pallets, and puts them into the traditional web development context, making them easily adoptable by Web3 builders, both rookies and veterans.


Apillonâ€™s unified point of access delivers Polkadot parachain functionalities simply through APIs. This way, developers can start creating Web3-based products from day one while mitigating or avoiding the abovementioned issues.


### Web3 development, simplified


Building with Apillon does not require prior knowledge of blockchain technology and allows developers to surpass the hassle of lengthy testing and auditing. A streamlined product development process saves resources and shortens the get-to-market timeline.


Simplification further applies to pricing. Instead of having to pay for supported Web3 services in their native tokens, which can be subject to high volatility, Apillon users can cover all at once with Apillonâ€™s NCTR token. Unified pricing plans in NCTR or fiat (EUR, USD) deliver price stability and predictability, ideal for enterprises and frequent users.


By lowering the entry barrier to Web3, Apillon democratizes the accessibility of distributed technologies. It delivers Web3 services to the millions of web developers who grew up with legacy technology stacks and seek to break into the web of the future.
