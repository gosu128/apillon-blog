It’s been a while since we have had our last community call, but with the flurry of new development we have announced in our latest blog post, we felt it was a tradition worth turning our attention back to.


Our latest AMA covered Apillon’s latest developments, the $NCTR token roadmap, community-driven incentives, aaaaand… presented the newest member of the team, Gal Jakič, Apillon Community manager! 🏅

With much of our team traveling — NFT Paris, Consensus Hong Kong, Web Summit Qatar — we kept it short but packed it with insights. Here’s what went down:


### Apillon’s latest product updates


Our Chief Product Officer, Nino, explained where Apillon stands today. The platform revolves around three main offerings:


The services primarily target Web2 and Web3 developers. Meanwhile, simplets are designed for agencies who need customizable solutions but have limited technical expertise.


### The $NCTR token: staking, incentives, and governance


Big news for $NCTR holders — staking is coming, with 20% APY for those who lock their tokens. But that’s just the beginning. Incentives will follow a seasonal model, ensuring rewards evolve based on participation and governance input.


#### Seasonal model


Apillon’s incentivization plan is structured around quarterly seasons, with the first staking season (Season 2) launching in Q2 2025. At the end of each season, token holders will have a say in adjusting incentives, extending specific rewards, or introducing new mechanisms for the next cycle. This isn’t just a top-down decision — $NCTR holders will be able to shape how staking evolves.


#### Lock, stake, and earn


To kick things off, the team offers 20% APY for token holders who lock their $NCTR and commit to the ecosystem. Once the staking feature is live, users will be able to manage their tokens through the dedicated staking dashboard, with two options available:


The goal? Rewarding actual participation — whether from individuals or companies — while ensuring $NCTR remains an attractive utility-driven asset within Apillon’s ecosystem.


### Community Q&A: Your top questions answered


We tackled some of the most common questions from the community — here’s a quick rundown:


#### Q: Will the Asset Hub supply of $NCTR stay on Asset Hub? Why is it there, and does the team plan any movement with it?


$NCTR was initially minted on Asset Hub to keep cross-chain bridging open as an option. After minting the total supply of 150M tokens, we moved 2/3 to Moonbeam, which serves as the primary chain for operations.


The remaining tokens on Asset Hub correspond to locked holdings, meaning they’ll stay put for now.


#### Q: “Check the list of Apillon grants and participate.” Where can I find the list of grants?


$NCTR’s first utility kicks off with passive 20% APY staking. Once that’s live, staking will unlock access to additional perks like discounts and other utilities. A structured grants program will follow, outlining available funding, eligibility, and how teams can apply — primarily for projects built using Apillon’s infrastructure.


#### Q: “Utilize our built-in referral system to invite users and receive $NCTR when someone joins.” Do users simply have to join, or is any activity required?


Referral rewards aren’t just for sign-ups — they scale based on activity. The more engaged a referred user is (e.g., using services, making payments), the higher the rewards.


#### Q: “Deploy your own dapps using Apillon and get rewarded for doing so.” What are the requirements for a dapp to be considered reward-eligible?


Details are still being finalized, but in general, a reward-eligible dapp must:✅ Be hosted on Apillon✅ Use Apillon’s API✅ Be a live, functional product with real users


#### Q: “Lock $NCTR and earn up to 20% APY.” Do I need to lock $NCTR for a specific period to be eligible? Is there a minimum locking period?


Yes, $NCTR staking will follow a seasonal model, with each season aligned to a quarterly cycle. Stakers can choose between 3-month and 12-month lock periods. Over time, governance participation will allow holders to help shape rewards, allocations, and token utilities.


The staking interface will offer an easy way to lock tokens, track rewards, and access additional benefits like discounts. More details will drop once the feature is fully developed.


#### Q: “Receive bonus $NCTR for production-ready dapps on Apillon.” What does Apillon consider production-ready?


The exact details of this bounty are still in the works, but in general, a production-ready dapp must be hosted on Apillon and integrated with our API. This ensures the project is live, functional, and actively used.


On a broader scale, we’re not just focused on Web3 — we’re also engaging with the Web2 space. Attending major conferences helps us track market trends, explore new parachain integrations, and identify opportunities to develop simplets that make Web3 more accessible for non-technical users.


We are committed to strengthening our engagement with the community through more frequent and transparent communication.


Yesterday’s AMA marks the start of an enhanced outreach initiative, with regular updates, interactive sessions, and new ways to connect. Our goal? To build Apillon with you and for you.


Your feedback and participation will help shape the platform as we continue to grow. Now, you can start building Web3 or check out Apillon’s product governance place first👇
