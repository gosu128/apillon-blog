### Apillon aims to foster Web3 adoption as a common good infrastructure solution on Polkadot


#### Transforming the Web3 development platform into a common-good solution would expedite and ease the Web3 onboarding of developers and exponentially advance Web3 adoption.


In its essence, the Apillon Web3 development platform brings blockchain technology closer to developers by mimicking the Web2 building logic. Using Apillon, millions of Web2 developers could adopt Web3 with just a few lines of code and harness the incredible potential of decentralized and Polkadot technologies.


Since the product’s inception, the feedback from the Polkadot community has been outstanding, dubbing the platform “the missing part of Polkadot”. The Web3 industry mainly focuses on protocol-level development; however, in order to boost mass adoption, we have to rethink the usability of the ground layers. The enhanced user experience and simplified access are yet to be applied methodically to the Web3 solutions.


To address the friction in accessibility, a solution like the Apillon platform should exist as an open-source and publicly accessible product to best tackle the Web3 adoption challenges, instead of being reliant on commercialization and VC private funding. It is why we are seeking support in funding and cooperation through the Polkadot Treasury.

### Apillon reshaping the Web3 space


The Polkadot framework is an excellent foundation for materializing the decentralized future. However, the builders still need to invest enormous efforts in research and development before writing the first line of code.


To fully utilize Polkadot’s full potential, the developers need a base that strips away the parachain complexity and offers a clean and abstracted infrastructure to rely on and build freely upon.


The Apillon platform tackles exactly the current building complexity in Web3 by streamlining the development process with a few-click implementation of use-case-specific Polkadot parachains and other key protocols and services.

### Apillon’s progress so far


In less than a year, Apillon grew into a multi-feature platform powered by sound ecosystem partnerships and fully-fledged services such as Web3 Storage and Web3 Hosting by Crust Network, and NFT Service powered by Moonbeam and Astar. To see how the services come together and enable an easier Web3 building, review the Apillon platform Short Demo video.

Every week, the platform undergoes upgrades and feature optimization, addressing the feedback and suggestions of more than 700 Beta users.


For a more detailed view of Apillon’s endeavors, you can find more information in Apillon’s 2022 review or in a Q1 report of our activities.

### Opportunities for Polkadot


Aligned with Polkadot’s multi-chain mission, the Apillon platform connects multiple parachains on a unified platform. Developers can access them using similar techniques and create advanced Web3 projects by merging decentralized features and addressing complex use cases simultaneously.


In Polkadot’s efforts to boost the number of newcomer devs to the ecosystem, Apillon can lend a hand by becoming a common good solution. The platform can further enrich the Web3 ecosystem by providing:


⧓ Easy access to Polkadot-based technologies and tools for more seasoned and rookie developers.


⧓ The option to work on multiple deployment-ready Web3 projects simultaneously.


⧓ Equal opportunities for every developer, regardless of their background and expertise.


⧓ Faster, easier, and cheaper engineering process in the Polkadot ecosystem.


⧓ More tangible application-layer products.


⧓ One-stop-shop for services that would otherwise have to be sourced from multiple individual providers.


⧓ Opportunity to build cross-chain solutions beyond asset transactions with faster deployment of multiple-parachain features.


⧓ Governance-regulated backlog of features and new integrations.


⧓ Community control over crucial centralized parts of the platform.


By receiving funding from the Polkadot Treasury, Apillon would commit to permanently keeping the Forever Freemium limited plan available for all users. This measure enhances the adoption of Polkadot technologies and gives back to the community that made the Treasury Proposal happen.


The project governance through Polkadot’s native token (DOT) would have a handle over the Forever Freemium limited plan — the governance outcomes would directly impact and fast-track the features or parachains to be integrated first.


To ensure Apillon is self-sufficient before the proposal period ends, business models would take the form of a typical SaaS price margin/fees, enabling the team to finance the operative costs from the platform’s revenue.


### Let’s make it a win-win situation


Throughout the past year, Apillon became one of the cornerstones for cooperation and parachain synergy in the Web3 sphere. As we are building the Web3 world, we greatly appreciate the support from the Web3 community and the Polkadot ecosystem to let us continue the work we have been successful and good at.


In the upcoming weeks, we will dedicate our time and resources to providing the answers to your questions, doubts, and potential issues that might surface while reading Apillon’s Polkadot Treasury Proposal.

We want to make the concept of Apillon’s Proposal as comprehensive and transparent as possible. We will do our best to smoothen the process of you casting a vote on the Polkadot Treasury once we cross that bridge. Until then, we will keep you posted about the next steps accordingly.
