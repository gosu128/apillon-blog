It‚Äôs all fun and games until the back-end needs an upgrade. In its quest to level up game performance, The Great Escape, a pioneer of Web3 gaming on the Moonbeam Network, moved to decentralized hosting with Apillon.


### The Great Escape to the Web3¬†jungle


A merge of the 90‚Äôs game aesthetics and NFT technology, The Great Escape is a free-to-play, hyper-casual Web3 game designed in a 2D platform style and deployed on Moonbeam as the first of its kind.

It caters to brave adventurers behind PC and mobile screens and rewards them for their advancement through the jungle, picking fruits and avoiding enemies and traps.


#### Web3 done gamer-friendly


In The Great Escape, it‚Äôs easy to get hooked. You don‚Äôt need a wallet to start the adventurous journey, and you get a free soulbound Gibbon character at hello. Besides, the gas-less nature of the game lets you enjoy it without having to pay any fees.


Soon, the game will be fully chain-agnostic and you will be able to claim rewards directly on-chain in the token of choice, from BTC and ETH to DOT and others.


After several iterations, the game is now in Closed Beta version with over 1,000 players and should go live in Q2 2024. In the meantime, The Great Escape keeps welcoming new players by organizing exciting tournaments.


#### GLMR Jungle¬†NFTs


Much like their real-life cousins, the in-game furry protagonists have a unique DNA as NFTs on the Moonbeam Network. On top of the free Gibbon characters, the game also presents the GLMR Jungle and the GLMR Apes characters, fruit-loving and chest-pounding troops roaming the Web3 woods.


GLMR Jungle NFT Apes represent the second collection of 1,001 pixel art NFTs brought by GLMR Apes and organized as the first Moonbeam DAO, with their own characters in the game. The NFTs from these two collections have special in-game perks and can be purchased on the tofuNFT or MoonBeans marketplaces, or rented on Double using GLMR, GLMB (game test token) or d2o.

#### Governed by a¬†DAO


It‚Äôs a jungle out there, but a civilized one‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäThe Great Escape nurtures collective voice and democratic governance. GLMR Apes DAO members can vote on-chain using Snapshot on every decision regarding the game, its features, and elements. Web3 for people, gamers for gamers.

However, as with many games, it‚Äôs party in the front, but serious business in the back. And soon, The Great Escape started taking a heavy toll on servers, compromising player experience‚Ä¶


### Next level: Decentralized hosting and custom cache by¬†Apillon


It‚Äôs no secret that centralized hosting of games (or any other online creature) is prone to downtime, or third-party impact that could downright cut users‚Äô access and even ruin their progress.


The Great Escape started off as a cloud-hosted game, but soon, the need for more robust and unstoppable hosting arose. Besides, for a 350 MB-heavy Web3 game with all its NFTs, features, and in-game assets, it‚Äôs no walk in the park to be run online.


Here is where Apillon came into play. By integrating the Decentralized Hosting service, the game upgraded to an IPFS-based hosting via Crust, with multiple replications across the globe, ensuring permanent access. Plus, in a custom enterprise plan, the Apillon development team created a game-specific cache to increase the game‚Äôs performance even at its size.

As the game development and distribution team behind The Great Escape said, ‚ÄúApillon‚Äôs technical solution was a problem-solver for us. Using decentralized hosting, we were able to create a fully IPFS-backed front-end for The Great Escape, creating an immutable gateway to our game.‚Äù


But it was more than just the infrastructure, and the ease of transition and accessibility played an equally important part. ‚ÄúWe continuously enjoyed the easy overall deployment process on Apillon. We have full control over our files and remain able to update them swiftly while enjoying a great uptime. For The Great Escape‚Äôs infrastructure, leveraging a decentralized solution such as Apillon‚Äôs hosting is definitely the right step towards what Web3 gaming should really be. Both ethically and technically,‚Äù concluded Mar1, CTO at The Great Escape.


And players noticed the difference, too. üöÄ
