### 4 biggest concerns about Web3 gaming


#### The emerging Web3 gaming is expected to blur the lines between the digital realm and the real world even more in the upcoming years.


In the last half-decade, the gaming industry has surpassed the earnings of Hollywood and the music industry combined. The ever-growing realm of gaming hasn’t stopped evolving since the appearance of the original arcade game in 1950.


### Games people play


The gaming industry has a strong history of innovation. Bringing arcade games to our homes, computerizing them later on, then enhancing those into virtual realities… so far, gaming has passed all tests of time, and people have successfully adopted new gaming tech like consoles, personal computers, laptops, VR sets, etc.


Rest assured, the vast gameverse will not stop procreating just because of the current upgrade or tech innovation accompanying it — as long as the basic expectation of every gameplayer is met: the compelling experience of gameplay, bringing joy, providing mental stimulation and reducing stress.


### It’s not just fun and Web3 games


While Web3 gaming holds tremendous promise, there has been some backlash about the underlying tech. Blockchain is still relatively new, which means scalability, security, and interfaces need further development. We’ve listed some common concerns for the future — coming both from Web3 newbies and the more blockchain-savvy crowd.


#### 1. User onboarding


Imagine it’s weekend, and you are thrilled to start playing the game you’ve been hearing about, finally. But.. not only are you no Web3 ninja, you don’t even have an on-chain wallet yet, and the whole pre-game mechanics are foreign to you.


Do you fight through the pain or dash to the known territories, back to your classic Web2 games? After all, it is the thrill of the game you are searching for, to run away from the complexity that is the rest of your life :)


Well, complicated interfaces are (for now), unfortunately, more of a rule than an exception for Web3 games. New users find it complex to navigate the technical maze. To successfully sail the Web3 gaming sea, one must possess at least basic knowledge of blockchain and cryptocurrency.


#### 2. User experience


Once onboarded, a new hustle might start. Currently, Web3 gaming cannot compare to Web2 gaming studios regarding the incredible quality of gaming production and the possibility of player progression.


Both of these features are crucial for the players' retention rates with certain games. In layman's terms — if the graphic landscape is not exactly what you’ve been picturing and you don’t even find that sense of growth for your character, you are more likely to hop on to the next best thing.


#### 3. In-game economics


There are two sides to every crypto coin. As the cryptocurrencies underline the payment systems in most Web3 games, there’s a play-to-earn (P2E) demand growing in the eyes of those who wish to work hard while playing hard.


First things first, the volatile crypto market. From a player’s point of view, it is hard to predict, therefore, to lead sustainable earning dynamics. And let’s not forget that in some cases, players spend money beforehand on some in-game assets like NFTs (providing character traits and other additional gaming experience).

On the other hand, the developers of Web3 games are facing a not-so-secure future because it is almost impossible to make sustainable business decisions that would result in stable revenue streams if they are basing their livelihood on inconsistent market growth. So, not ideal. Yet!


#### 4. User data


It is true, yes, that one of the most praised traits of blockchain tech is data ownership. It promises a more responsible future by preventing the toxic and involuntary exchange of the most precious and valuable currency there is — personal data.


Nevertheless, in Web3 gaming, complying with privacy laws like GDPR and keeping data safe is of the essence. This means there are still some kinks to be worked out regarding collecting player data, profiling, and securing personal details. Dealing with changing global privacy rules and ensuring you’re following the law when handling user data in Web3 can be a tricky mission.


### What lies ahead?


While it faces challenges, Web3 gaming has the potential to reshape the gaming landscape. As technology matures, Web3 gaming is poised to lead the way into a new era of gaming in which players are not just participants but actual stakeholders in the virtual worlds they inhabit.


The future of Web3 is bright as long as we build it and promote it the right way. Only added value must be left when we strip it of the hype and flashy things. Focusing on solutions and benefits rather than pushing blockchain tech per se is the way to go.


There are already some great success stories of a perfect Web3 gaming jumpstart — The Great Escape, for example, a game that is hosted via Apillon and offers you a great insight into what can be built in a decentralized fashion.
