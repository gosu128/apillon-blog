### Embedded Wallets 2.0: All the power, none of the pain


#### Making Web3 simple wasn’t easy enough — we made it even easier to access and benefit from its tech. Number 7 rocks!


Web3 is packed with potential, but for most people, it still feels like trying to assemble IKEA furniture without the manual. It looks easy, but then.. it almost never is.


Embedded wallets offer a different approach. With every update, we’re making Web3 more accessible, removing the technical headaches, and bringing the benefits of decentralized tech to the masses — without forcing them to understand every blockchain buzzword.


With that in mind, welcome to Embedded Wallets 2.0! We’ve packed it with game-changing upgrades to make your Web3 experience smoother, more flexible, and, honestly, just better.


Here’s what’s new:


∘ 1. Global passkey support ∘ 2. Network switching ∘ 3. Private key import & export option ∘ 4. UI redesign ∘ 5. Multi-accounts (+ account labels) per wallet ∘ 6. Token balance + USD value display ∘ 7. Flexible passkey authentication modes ∘ 8. Transaction history UI — revamped

Let’s break it all down.


#### 1. Global passkey support


Passwords? Those are so Web2. Passkeys are secure cryptographic keys stored on your device that let you access your wallet using biometrics — think Face ID, fingerprint, or your device PIN. No passwords, no phishing risks, just seamless security.


Apillon’s Embedded Wallets are built on Oasis Confidential Smart Contracts, and now they’re globally available, meaning they’re no longer tied to a single app. Your wallet can now interact across multiple applications without extra setup.


#### 2. Network switching


Jumping between blockchain networks shouldn’t feel like switching phone carriers. With 2.0 version, it now doesn’t feel this way at all. Seamlessly swap networks within your Embedded Wallets without losing sleep over configurations.


#### 3. Private key import & export option


We believe in freedom — so we’re giving you the ability to import your private key into Apillon’s Embedded Wallet ecosystem or export it to use elsewhere. No vendor lock-in, no hoops to jump through. Just a wallet that works the way you want it to.


#### 4. UI redesign


We love great tech, but we also know it needs to look and feel great to be usable. This redesign isn’t just a fresh coat of paint — it’s about reducing friction and making onboarding smoother than ever. Because a tool is only as good as how easy it is to use.


#### 5. Multi-accounts (+ account labels) per wallet


How many wallets do you carry in your pocket right now? Just one? But somehow, your brain is juggling a work budget, a savings account, and that ‘just-in-case’ fund for impulse buys.


Your embedded wallet can now do the same — with multiple accounts in one wallet and custom labels to keep everything organized. Web3 finance, but make it practical.


#### 6. Token balance + USD value display


We all got into Web3 for the tech… but also, keeping track of your tokens shouldn’t require mental math at all times. Now, you can see both your token balances and their USD value directly in your wallet. Because numbers should work for you, not the other way around.


#### 7. Flexible passkey authentication modes


Hate when tech forces you into a single workflow? Same. Now, you can choose how passkey authentication works for your users:


Your app, your rules.


#### 8. Transaction history UI — revamped


Bank statements are a snooze. And Web3 can do better. Our revamped transaction history UI makes tracking your activity a visual treat, not a chore. Who knew finance could actually be nice to look at?


### Apillon provides more power with less complexity


Embedded Wallets 2.0 isn’t just an update — it’s a leap forward in making Web3 more intuitive, more flexible, and more user-friendly than ever.
