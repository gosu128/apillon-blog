### Web3 Adoption: Key issues


#### Subtitle


Web3, also known as the decentralized web or the blockchain-based web, presents a promising alternative to the traditional centralized web by enabling peer-to-peer transactions without the need for intermediaries. However, there are several key issues that must be addressed to promote widespread adoption of web3:


1. Usability: Web3 applications are often complex and difficult to use, requiring technical expertise and familiarity with blockchain concepts. Improving the user experience and making web3 more accessible to non-technical users is crucial for adoption.


2. Scalability: Current blockchain infrastructures have limitations in terms of scalability and throughput, which could impede the growth of web3 applications. Solutions such as sharding, layer-2 protocols, and sidechains are being developed to address this issue.


3. Interoperability: There are numerous blockchains, each with their own protocols and standards, making it difficult for different blockchain-based systems to communicate with one another. Interoperability protocols like Polkadot and Cosmos are being developed to address this issue.


4. Regulation: The regulatory environment for web3 is still uncertain in many jurisdictions, which could impede adoption by limiting investment and development. Clear guidelines and frameworks for the regulation of web3 are needed to provide certainty and encourage growth.


5. Security: Web3 applications are subject to new security risks, including smart contract vulnerabilities, hacking attacks, and wallet thefts. Improving security standards and protocols is critical to protect users and ensure the reliability of the web3 ecosystem.


Overall, addressing these key issues will be crucial to the successful adoption of web3 and the realization of its potential to transform the internet and the way we interact with technology.


### Stagnating ecosystem, lack of innovation


The current blockchain ecosystem is stagnating, and if we don’t see innovation, the future of this industry will be dire.


### Tribalism and barrier of entry


Due to the tribalism and the barrier of entry, we cannot see fresh ideas coming to the ecosystem.


### Complex logics and difficult implementation


Difficult to implement complex logics in smart contracts.


### Lack of secure interoperability


Not enough secure interoperability for dapps to rely on.


### Lack of user-centric solutions


Utility and end-user value is not a metric of success in the blockchain world. It is easier and more profitable to fork a EVM project than to make something new.


### Lack of innovation


No incentivization for being innovative.
