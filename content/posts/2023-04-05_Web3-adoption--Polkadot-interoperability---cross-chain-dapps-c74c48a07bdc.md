### Web3 adoption: Polkadot interoperability & cross-chain dapps


#### Cross-chain dapps deliver richer features and better user experience, operate across different networks, and can attract a larger user base.

### What is interoperability and why does it matter?


Not all dapps were created equal. In their architectural essence, they are built on different networks or protocols, each optimized for a specific purpose and, as a result, deliver different features.


But to expand capabilities, boost relevance, and attract the highest number of users possible from all corners of the Web3 space, dapps should shed reliance on a single, native blockchain, and support interaction, communication, and exchange of data and value across different blockchain network in the most seamless possible way.


Interoperability — the ability to operate “inter-networkingly” — allows dapps to benefit from the features of non-native networks in addition to their innate capabilities. Without it, a dapp is confined to only its native blockchain ecosystem, severely limiting its possibilities for product evolution, feature improvement, and market expansion.


Cross-chain communication is therefore essential for the adoption of Web3 technologies, products, and dapps built upon them, and the growth of the ecosystem at large. Users know best, and if they can’t use a Web3 product on a network they prefer, they are more likely to abandon it or fail to start using it altogether.


#### Interoperability but make it innate


To achieve interoperability in a dapp, you could typically utilize cross-chain protocols, including atomic swaps, sidechains, and cross-chain bridges. In their essence, these protocols were designed to enable trustless and secure transfer of data and assets across chains.


However, recent exploits have also exposed vulnerabilities, particularly in cross-chain bridges, hurting user assets and trust. Besides, developing interoperable capabilities in a dapp could be a daunting task that hinders the adoption of Web3 technologies.


To avoid a single point of risk and ease cross-chain communication, interoperability should be an inherent feature of a network or protocol, not a third-party service with a high barrier to use.


### Interoperability on Polkadot


The Polkadot Network has been addressing the question of interoperability by design since its conception.


In its unique architecture, multiple niche-oriented blockchains (parachains) operate independently in catering to specific use cases. For example, Crust Network is optimized for secure and scalable decentralized storage, while KILT Protocol goes all-in into decentralized authentication of digital assets.


At the same time, all parachains are connected to the main network called the Polkadot Relay Chain and secured by the same set of validators in Polkadot’s security model. This way, they can exchange data and assets securely, following the same protocol.

#### Cross-Chain Messaging system (XCM)


XCM is one of the critical features of the Polkadot Network, setting it apart from other Web3 ecosystems. This highly complex language format for cross-chain data exchange supports secure transfer of both simple tokens and feature-rich assets like NFTs across multiple blockchains and even external networks. Its programmable nature is also capable of turning messages into a kind of computer program executable on different networks.

Contrary to bridges, Polkadot’s cross-chain messaging protocol (XCMP), is a no-intermediary mechanism of cross-chain communication, cutting reliance on a trusted third party and thus reducing risks of exploits.


And, as a cross-consensus messaging system, it further supports data exchange between smart contracts, Substrate pallets, via bridges, and even connects networks with different consensus mechanisms, like Bitcoin (proof-of-work) and Polkadot (proof-of-stake).


#### Bridge protocols


The Polkadot Network also inherently supports the implementation of bridge protocols, such as the Polkadot Bridge Protocol. These bridges connect to the Relay Chain, and allow data transfers from one network to another, as well as between Polkadot and external blockchain networks, such as Ethereum, while sharing security through the Polkadot consensus mechanism. Besides, the Chainlink integration lets Polkadot-based dapps use external data sources and oracles across multiple chains.


In general, Polkadot’s architecture was designed to sustain cross-chain communication and dapp interoperability, making it a go-to platform for developers building dapps that require cross-network data exchange.


But what if you’re new to the space or just want to harness all the cross-chain capabilities without having to dive deep into the code, protocols, frameworks, and smart contracts?


### Cross-chain dapps made easy


Cross-chain dapps deliver richer features and better user experience, operate across different networks, and can attract greater Web3 and Web2 communities.


Unless you deliberately confine a dapp to a single network, its interoperability and cross-chain capabilities should be on your mind since the first day of the dapp building process.


You could go the long route and build the core infrastructure, test and integrate the cross-chain mechanism fit for your dapp, and develop every feature by sourcing the code from both its native and external parachain networks, as well as the chosen cross-chain mechanism.


Or, you could cut the story short using the multi-chain by-design Apillon platform, attach the Web3 services you need, and deploy. The Apillon dashboard gives you access to multiple Polkadot-based Web3 services at once so you can choose and deploy as you please, and have them communicate with each other from day one.


In the back-end, Apillon links to the supported Polkadot parachains while respecting their protocols, connectivity to the relay chain, and cross-chain capabilities. The platform’s front-end, however, abstracts all the development complexity and funnels it down to a sleek dashboard, delivering parachain functionalities in two ways:

#### Cross-chain dapps at your fingertips


In the Closed Beta phase of the Apillon platform, you can create cross-chain dapps that employ Web3 Storage and Web3 Hosting service by Crust Network and the IPFS protocol.

Soon, however, you will be able to expand your dapps’ capabilities by accessing more connected networks and their features. The upcoming platform upgrades will let you create NFT collections on the Moonbeam Network, integrate Web3 Authentication through decentralized identifiers (DIDs) via the KILT Protocol, and employ Web3 Computing in the decentralized cloud powered by Phala Network. And, they will all work together seamlessly to power your cross-chain Web3 product.

By making dapp interoperability attainable to every developer, regardless of their experience with Web3, Apillon aims to boost the adoption of decentralized technologies and deliver them in a way that supports broad communicability with the ecosystem from the first click onwards.


Tap into a wider and deeper pool of cross-chain features and create more agile, powerful, and user-friendly Web3 solutions.
