### Authtrail rebranded: A metamorphosis into Apillon


#### Through the Authtrail brand, we managed to position ourselves as a vital member of the Web3 ecosystem. Now, with Apillon, we’ll double down on supporting the world in its transition to Web3.


The journey through numerous iterations and learnings these past months made us realize that Authtrail’s brand identity couldn’t keep up with the evolution of our product. However, we never backed away from the initial goal of becoming the cornerstone of Web3 adoption, and the new, polished and perfected brand identity is even more vocal about it.

We give you Apillon, a Web3 development platform empowering developers to build applications in the Polkadot ecosystem easily using APIs and other linked Web3 services.


### From Authtrail to Apillon


Since 2019, it’s been our goal to create simpler solutions to complex issues. And right before our eyes, our focus grew bigger and evolved in what it could bring to the table.


First, we built an easy-to-use data integrity solution to bridge the gap between enterprise data and security provided by blockchain technology. We delivered increased data transparency and traceability that enterprises could easily harness. By hashing the data on the blockchain, a.k.a. “setting the data in stone”, we provided them with an authenticity trail, hence Authtrail was chosen as the brand name.


But the ever-growing market demand for Web3 services beyond protecting data made us reflect on our work, and, zooming out, we realized the end users need a more general solution that would lead to wider adoption of blockchain.

But how to attract more users to adopt blockchain technology in general? First and foremost, by onboarding more Web3 developers to create easy-to-use and advanced applications, products and other services powering the future web. And how to achieve that? By providing them with basic building blocks with straightforward and mix-and-match APIs and plug-ins, adapted to every developer’s skillset.


### The story behind the name Apillon


The name Apillon was coined to illustrate our brand’s story and the mission we are on. It consists of two separate terms — API and Papillon.


Apillon introduces the most effective way to bring Web3 services to real-life usability through its development platform that delivers straightforward APIs to linked parachain functionalities. Building Web3 products becomes as effortless as a butterfly’s wing flap.


The native token of Apillon is changing its ticker symbol from AUT to NCTR, pronounced nectar, the food of butterflies, and referencing the way the NCTR token powers the Apillon platform.


### Setting the butterfly effect in motion


The metaphor of a caterpillar turning into a butterfly can be linked to many parables. The one Apillon is built upon represents the Web3 evolution that sprouted through innovation and advancement of previous Web system networks, Web1 and Web2.


Web1 (the egg) was a static and the most basic network, while Web2 (the caterpillar) set the web in motion by offering a plethora of participatory means for everyone to partake as a creator — whether as a developer, content creator, or a regular observer.


With the rise of the big tech, users soon realized the setbacks of centralization, web monetization, and uncertain ownership over their personal data. To propose a new web paradigm, visionary developers started building the foundation of the open, permissionless, and trustless Web3 (the butterfly).


### Visual identity — boldness in simplicity

The Apillon logo austerity is softened by organic illustrations that add playfulness and dynamics to the brand’s entire visual identity. Together, they represent the main graphic building blocks, allowing us to create either realistic or fictional images to guide users through the story of Web3, the Apillon platform, and all it has to offer.


The colors used — calming hues with pastel accents — mimic the developer’s software environment and color coding in programming.


The mastermind behind the new brand identity is Apillon’s Lead Designer Jure Sobočan, a senior graphic designer based in Slovenia, specializing in UX and UI design and known as a design expert in the blockchain sphere.


### Apillon: The go-to platform for Web3 developers


After months of plotting, tweaking and upgrading, we’re proud to share the early fruits of our work. Much, much more is yet to come, and is set to reshape the way we think about Web3 development and adoption.


Indeed, the claims are bold and the goals are high, but so is our determination to connect the broader Web3 ecosystem and provide everyone with a common ground to build upon.
