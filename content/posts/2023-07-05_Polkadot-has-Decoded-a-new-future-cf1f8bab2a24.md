### Polkadot has Decoded a new future


#### The Web3 building sphere, from developers to marketers, business owners and corporate representatives, united under the same roof.


Each edition of Polkadot Decoded so far offered more and more in-depth content, and this year’s event followed in a similar fashion. Polkadot’s founder and Chief Architect, Gavin Wood, shed light on the newly minted future plans for the Polkadot blockchain. Or shall we say blockspace.

Since the better part of the Apillon team attended the conference, each had their own favorite talk or panel — so no consensus on the top 3 things there. But some of the team members felt olympic enough to write their own thoughts about their favorite conference snippets.

### What was Apillon up to at Polkadot Decoded


#### 1 Polkadot Decoded — Opening night


To kick the conference off in style, Apillon co-organized a social hour together with Astar Network, Crust Network and Phala Network. The amazing venue H15 Food & Culture was packed! After the short keynote speeches by the organizers, the food filled our bellies and souls and the real mingling began. We just couldn’t get enough of chatting with old Web3 friends and making new ones.

#### 2 “Build Web3 like it’s 1993" talk by Matjaž Sobočan, CEO at Apillon


The Apillon platform exceeded the initial expectations of Beta platform user numbers. Currently, we are integrating and implementing the fourth fully-fledged service. Matjaž took the audience on a stroll from Apillon’s inception to today's success, also mentioning the joint initiative Web3Approved with Crust Network.

#### 3 Apillon demo: Schrödinger’s NFT


The newly cooked Shrödinger’s NFT demonstration impressed quite a lot of visitors at Apillon’s Showcase station booth. Since it’s just the demo of a service that will be fully deployed on the platform in the next few months, you can expect more news about it coming your way very soon. In collaboration with Phala Network and their Phat Contracts, here’s a preview of the box. And as the demo took its sweet time to start demoing, Apillon’s CPO assured the disbelieving spectators with what seemed to become a legendary quote:

#### 4 Apillon live from Decoded, Day 1


Apillon’s CEO, Matjaž Sobočan, had a pretty tight schedule with all the interviews, meetings and networking. In his conversation with Ben Greenberg, he talked about badminton, development, and other Web3 classics. Listen to Matjaž and Ben here:

### What impressed us the most at Polkadot Decoded


#### 1 Gavin Wood and the plans for Polkadot 2.0 (keynote)

[Gavin Wood](https://twitter.com/gavofyork?lang=en)

Written by Nino Kutnjak, CPO at Apillon:

[Nino Kutnjak](https://si.linkedin.com/in/nino-kutnjak)

“Polkadot is soon reaching v1.0, which means all features predicted in the Whitepaper will be achieved and on production. That said, most of the audience expected conservative roadmaps to upkeep the version and enter the era of slower and controlled updates. Boy, were we wrong! Gav came to the stage prepared. Not only the new vision is mindblowing and again brings a completely new perspective to Polkadot and the whole blockchain industry, it is also presented in a human-centered way only real masters can deliver.


Long story short, by applying analog thinking, Gav and other founders concluded that we will all look at Polkadot blockspace as a security commodity with a specific price. Polkadot will “logically” be separated into “cores” similar to the typical CPU, where anyone who will need a secure block will be able to get it on-demand and by “pay-what-you-spend” models.


This is a massive game-changer because it aligns the Polkadot business model to standard business models used for the past ten years and it allows Polkadot projects to focus straight on the enterprise level where scaling pricing is ultra important.”

It is hard to summarize all that was said, especially how it was said, so we suggest you take time and see the video of the history being made:


#### 2 The Decentralized Web: How Much Regulation is Necessary? (panel)


Written by Domen Uršič, CMO at Apillon:

“As we dive deeper and further out into the sea of crypto’s uncharted policies and regulatory voids, this panel provided much-needed clarity for us players, making a living on the blockchain side of the tech sphere.


Despite having different backgrounds, I believe there was a clear thread of consensus. The EU offers clear regulation, keeping in mind that Web3 needs endless support, not hindering the adoption we achieved so far.


Amazed by the depth and maturity of the panel debate! We really want to keep talking with the regulators, seeing the reforms as a necessity that would finally draw a line in the theoretical sand and the real world we live in.”

#### 3 KILT Protocol’s Enterprise Adoption: KYC/KYB with Deloitte (shared speech)


Written by Tadej Vengust, CTO at Apillon:

[Tadej Vengust](https://si.linkedin.com/in/tadej-vengust)

“To see blockchain technology in everyday use is what the Web3 industry strives towards. But seeing one of the big corporations showcasing their newly integrated DLT tech is really a sight for a sore Web3 preacher’s eye.


Deloitte is transforming the verification process by offering reusable digital credentials anchored on the KILT blockchain. This can significantly lower companies’ KYC costs since their users already have valid KYC credentials. End customers can benefit from using their credentials across multiple services: it’s cost-effective, it’s convenient. It’s what we all want blockchain to be.”

#### Networking, connecting, sightseeing and teambuilding


So many people and teams to greet, so little time. We strategically divided and conquered the conference floor with thorough mingling and chatting about Web3, the weird Danish weather, or just life in general.


We also felt it was important to take the time and hang out with the Apillon team and strengthen the bonds. It’s hard to believe, we know, but we actually like each other a lot! :)

We hope to share the stage with other Web3 movers and shakers real soon and update the community about the newest Apillon adventures and successes.
