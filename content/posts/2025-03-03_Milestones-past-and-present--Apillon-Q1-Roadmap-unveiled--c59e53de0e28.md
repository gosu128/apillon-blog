### Milestones past and present: Apillon Q1 Roadmap unveiled!


#### Exciting announcements are on the horizon as we unveil our roadmap for Q1.

Apillon’s roadmap is structured at least 6 months in advance and split up in two broad categories: improvements to the existing services as efforts to add services to the Apillon platform.


The first category — improvements to the existing Apillon services — mainly stems from the feedback of our user base as well as extensive internal team testing and analytics. These are the activities, where our development and product teams identify most of the UX and DX issues and rough edges that need to be addressed for the users to feel supported in their leap from Web2 to Web3.


The latter is the effort spent on trying to identify upcoming services, that would benefit the users of the Apillon platform in making sure they can find all the necessary services within the platform, tested and supported by our own development team as well as documented thoroughly in our unified API documentation.


### Why just Q1 and not the whole 2025?


With some of the shifts and some of the deliverables being outside our control, as well as new trends and use-cases, as well as trying to stay a step ahead of our competition, we will be unveiling the offering quarter-by-quarter.


### What is to come in remainder of Q1?


Besides the already teased functionality that will allow Apillon $NCTR holders to lock and earn a high 20% APY, we are planning on addressing these specific areas:


Let’s dive into each one individually to give you a more broad picture of why they warrant changes within the Apillon platform.


#### Embedded Wallets


Embedded wallets are one of the features with the highest potential impact for Web3 adoption and, consequently, Polkadot adoption. Before releasing the feature, we received significant interest from various stakeholders, companies, and existing dapps to integrate our wallets.


Additionally, we’ve encountered requests to support embedded wallets from native mobile dapps.


By the end of Q1, we expect that the list of our features for our embedded wallets will have grown significantly — to a point, where they will warrant a separate, in-depth blog post.


#### Deploy projects directly from your GitHub


Currently, the NFT collection deployment flow allows users to create NFT collections using a no-code wizard. The process automates several steps in the background, such as:


However, once the NFT collection is created, the final step offers users a GitHub repository with a pre-written NFT collection website. This requires users to:


This complexity following a streamlined wizard experience often leads to incomplete projects, with many collections created but fewer actually reaching the NFT minting stage.


To address this, Apillon will expand the no-code wizard with an automated website deployment step to simplify this process. In this step, the platform will:


#### Upcoming changes on the Apillon website & within the platform


Our last big update to our website is just over two years old, which we believe roughly translates to “too old” in Web3. The changes to the website will reflect new services being added, our product being more refined and better targeted and suited as a resource our customer base can use to build new exciting projects, but also grow their understanding of Web3 tech and its benefits.


On the platform side, we have a huge revamp of our onboarding flow — doubling down on service descriptions, making our messaging clearer and the overall user experience better for new and existing users.


Our revamped approach will also allow users to achieve the same outcomes, no matter whether they started their journey via pre-made wizard flow or directly accessing the underlying services through our code tooling.


And did we mention that this is the Q, where $NCTR is getting integrated into the platform? After that, the only queue we expect is for the lock and earn a 20% APY.


#### Hey, you said surprise!


We did. We’re keeping one or two wildcards under wraps for now, but they will surely be getting all the spotlight they deserve once they are out.


Maybe the winter is wearing off, or maybe it’s just our roadmap heating up…
