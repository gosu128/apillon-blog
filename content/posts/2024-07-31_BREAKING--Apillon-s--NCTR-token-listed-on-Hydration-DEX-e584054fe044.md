Thanks to Hydration Omnipool, an innovative Automated Market Maker (AMM), the Hydration DEX delivers an ocean of liquidity by combining all assets in a single trading pool.


Unlike fragmented liquidity found on other platforms, Hydration‚Äôs unified liquidity pool ensures its traders can enjoy high capital efficiency and lower slippage.

Besides, Hydration addresses the issue of impermanent loss (IL) frequently occuring in AMMs using non-inflationary measures. This way, Hydration‚Äôs liquidity providers can experience less IL compared to other platforms‚Äô liquidity pools.
