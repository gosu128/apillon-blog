### Making the impossible possible


Phala Network maintains its cloud computing network mainly off-chain in secure enclaves to ensure scalability and security in its cloud service. Such trustless infrastructure enables use cases for massive data exchanges between parties.

With Phat Contracts, developers can create a range of Web3 applications and build highly-capable Web3 project without performance concerns.


### Joint efforts boosting Web3 productivity


Phalaâ€™s services foster agile blockchain functions and transactions, resulting in higher execution speed compared to other blockchains providing computing power. Through the Apillon platform, the APIs to employ computing power will smooth out and streamline the way Web3 projects perform.


Once Phala is integrated into Apillon in the Web3 Computing service, developers will be able to not only run smart contracts but also employ elaborate data analytics, complex app simulations and other operations.


Slowly but surely, the Apillon platform will evolve to offer all the integral services in a complete basic toolkit for developing dapps from start to finish in no time. Apillon Closed Beta is in progress as we speak, and the first testers can build or upgrade their projects using Web3 Storage and Web3 Hosting.
