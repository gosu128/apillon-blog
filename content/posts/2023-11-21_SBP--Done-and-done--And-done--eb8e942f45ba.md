### SBP: Done and done. AndÂ done!


#### Apillon is concluding the official Substrate Builders Program attendance but will continue working closely with the SBPÂ team.


Completing all the Substrate Builders Program milestones rounds up the crucial learning period, accompanied by Parityâ€™s extensive expertise and numerous resources offered to Apillon.


The Apillon team hopes to count on future support and review-wise help, both from the Substrate Builders Program team and fellow Web3 participants weâ€™ve been in touch with through the program.


### Milestones: crossed off theÂ list


It is time to sow our oats. To plant the seed. To... well, to start using all the knowledge and make use of all the skills honed. But first, we have to show off a bit by presenting all three Milestones, skillfully mastered.


We have already shared goals reached and expectations set about Milestone 1 and Milestone 2; read more about them below ðŸ‘‡

On our way to Milestone 3, we were soon aware it could be completed ahead of time. But we figured why not add some additional features to the list of tasks and use the amazing skillset of the revision team to get as much technical feedback as possible. Yes, yesâ€¦ we truly are geeks. And we love it.


A condensed review of what was happening for the past two months on the Apillon platform:
