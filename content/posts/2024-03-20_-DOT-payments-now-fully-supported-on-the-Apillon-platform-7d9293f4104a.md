### $DOT payments now fully supported on the Apillon platform


#### Apillon integrates NOWpayments to offer a seamless $DOT payment option on their Web3 development platform.


To provide a seamless cost management solution, Apillon is adding a cryptocurrency payment option for purchasing credits on its Web3 development platform.


Users can now pay with $DOT tokens via newly integrated NOWpayments and become fully decentralized while building and through the financial part of their Web3 projects.

NOWpayments is a noncustodial cryptocurrency payment gateway that provides efficient and secure solutions and facilitates financial transactions. Its comprehensive toolkit has already convinced businesses worldwide, and it’s now powering the crypto-financial side of Apillon.


Crypto payments have repeatedly proven to be game-changers in the world of digital finance. It is high time Web3 users started demanding simple onboarding processes for crypto payment contributions when building blockchain-based solutions.


### All for DOT and DOT for all


Apillon’s business model, payments, and other financial mechanics revolve around the $DOT token, so $DOT is utilized as a main crypto payment option on the Apillon platform.


Why only $DOT if the Web3 Services on the platform are provided by individual Polkadot parachains, each powered by their own token?


Apillon is set on providing a unified pricing system that enables developers to focus on building new products rather than dealing with crypto volatility, holding multiple tokens, and figuring out complex payment processes.


And it’s a triple-win situation. The value of $DOT ultimately depends on its utility within the Polkadot network. So, if Web3 builders can efficiently execute their business in $DOT, the demand for assets within the Polkadot ecosystem, namely $DOT, increases.


This could drive up $DOT’s price and, in the meantime, make it more widely used for processes such as governance, staking, transaction fees, or other essential functions within the Polkadot network.


### Apillon platform Credits and Subscription plans


Why is there no single way to pay for Apillon’s Web3 Services? Because Apillon’s 2-fold method provides builders with the most flexible and cheapest options depending on their Web3 building needs.


⧓ If one requires recurring Web3 functionalities like website hosting and content storage, monthly Subscription plans are the most suitable option. They will provide lifetime storage capacity and monthly bandwidth—one can choose among three plans, depending on the desired volume.


⧓ In addition, when one requires one-time-execution Web3 services, like NFT collection minting, there are platform Credits at disposal. They work as a pay-as-you-go model, meaning a person buys as many credits as needed and as often as needed. And can now be paid with $DOT.


### How to figure out what you need?


The Credits and Subscription plans are complementary and intended to be used in an overlapping manner. To determine the type of building work builders will perform on the platform and what they will need, complementary credits and an automatic Freemium subscription plan are already active at registration. Everyone can use free credits and free Web3 services functionalities as they see fit and proceed from there to choose the plan that would work for them.


No credit card, no prior commitment—developers start paying if and when they decide to do so.
