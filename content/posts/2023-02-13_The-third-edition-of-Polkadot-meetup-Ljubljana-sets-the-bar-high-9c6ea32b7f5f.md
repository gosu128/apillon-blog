### The third edition of Polkadot meetup Ljubljana sets the bar high


#### The franchise of Polkadot meetup Ljubljana events is becoming one of the leading Web3 events in the wider region.


Judging by the unprecedented turnout at Apillon’s first Polkadot meetup Ljubljana in 2023, the year ahead seems to be marked by the word Web3.


After two full house events at the end of last year, we were prepared for another packed event, and yet, we were still taken aback by the amazing energy the diverse group of blockchain and Web3 enthusiasts contributed — among the numerous newcomers, one could recognize many familiar faces from previous events.


### This edition was special to Apillon— for multiple reasons


This was the first time co-founder and CEO at Apillon Matjaž Sobočan was able to greet the crowd live at the venue of Polkadot Meetup Ljubljana. Sharing the start of his career in the IT and blockchain world, he took the participants onto an exciting journey — right to the beginning of Apillon’s story.

As a highly-anticipated treat, Apillon’s CPO Nino Kutnjak presented a demo of the freshly released Closed Beta version of the Apillon platform after explaining in detail how the platform currently delivers Web3 hosting and storage services, provided by Crust Network in the background.

Valery Gantchev, Head of Propaganda at HydraDX, explained how the next-gen DeFi protocol brings an ocean of liquidity to Polkadot. With their Omnipool, any project or DAO Treasury can provide liquidity using XCM and gain instant exposure to an ocean of assets.

And last but not least, we hosted an experienced software engineer Stanko Krstič, to address mainly the developer part of the audience. He explained why Rust is one of the most powerful programming languages for optimizing memory safety management, concurrency, and performance.

And how did Stanko get to that realization? Oh, just by re-writing a hobby project originally written in Go and getting the program computation time down from 90 minutes to a mere 4 minutes in Rust! Stanko’s presentation was so well-delivered, even the less technically savvy amongst us were all ears.
