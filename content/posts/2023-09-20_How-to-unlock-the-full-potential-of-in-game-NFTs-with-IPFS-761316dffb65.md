### How to unlock the full potential of in-game NFTs withÂ IPFS


#### NFTs bring plenty of opportunities for gamers and game makers. Hereâ€™s why itâ€™s crucial NFT metadata files are stored with IPFS to prevent the loss of in-gameÂ NFTs.


NFTs in gaming are nothing newâ€Šâ€”â€Šsince the first surge of NFTs in art and collectibles around 2020, major gaming brand partnerships have been announced to tap into the potential of innovative blockchain technology.


The hype is real as NFTs introduce a wide range of exciting possibilities into the gaming sector, including the true ownership of digital assets and the possibility for gamers to earn income with the play-to-earn principle.


The catch? If not stored in a fully secure, distributed and reliable way, the centrally stored NFT metadata, which is a crucial part of the NFT, could be hacked or lost. This would render the in-game NFT assets worthless.


Hackings and other breaches that cause data loss can shake the trust of the industry as a whole. Fortunately, IPFS can provide trustworthy and secure NFT metadata storage for Web3 gaming.


### The exciting possibilities of NFTs inÂ gaming


Since the initial boom of NFTs in gaming in 2020, NFTs have been adopted by popular games like Fortnite, with major companies like Ubisoft and Square Enix quickly following to look into possible use cases. In 2022, we witnessed the emergence of NFT marketplaces that cater specifically to gamers.


According to S&P Global Market Intelligence, video game publishers make over $3.6bn a year in revenue from in-game NFTs. By 2027, this number could rise to $15bn.


But game makers arenâ€™t the only ones profiting from Web3 gaming by prolonging the longevity of playing and increasing player engagement.


#### How can players benefit from the use of NFTs inÂ gaming?


Besides providing a more immersive gaming experience, Web3 gaming adds a new element of profitability for players.


By offering an attractive price for the playerâ€™s time and effort, Web3 games encourage more engagement and longer retention.


With the use of NFTs, game developers can create unique and rare in-game assets and items for players. This includes skins, weapons, characters, and even in-game real estate that players can collect, trade, and sell not only in the game itself but also at various NFT marketplaces.


Sure, traditional gaming also lets you obtain rare in-game assets, but you do not truly own themâ€Šâ€”â€Šthe gaming company does.


Many traditional games like Pokemon Go forbid their players to sell accounts or in-game assets. Enter NFTs.


As per Wikipediaâ€™s definition, a non-fungible token (NFT) is a unique digital identifier that is stored and recorded on a blockchain. Since it canâ€™t be copied, substituted, or divided, itâ€™s the ideal technology to certify ownership and authenticity of various digital items, including in-game assets.

With NFTs, Web3 gaming allows gamers to take full control and ownership of their in-game assets, allowing them to sell or trade the items.


In-game asset interoperability allows players to trade and use the items across multiple gaming platforms and ecosystems.


NFTs can connect different games, replacing the current walled-garden model of traditional gaming, where in-game assets are tied to a single game.


Whatâ€™s in it for gamers? Besides a fuller gaming experience, the long hours of hard work they dedicated to a single game can be transferred to a different one.


With the rise of play-to-earn games, players are being rewarded for their engagement in the game.


While the rewards can be small amounts of cryptocurrency, they can also come in the shape of NFTs. When a player receives a rare in-game asset for a task completed or a battle won, they become the true owner of that asset. And again, they can trade it or sell it as they wish.


When the creator mints an NFT, they must set a percentage for royalties. Every time a secondary sale of the NFT occurs, the original creator receives a cut of the profit, or royalties.


The same happens in Web3 gamingâ€Šâ€”â€Šas royalties are written into the smart contract, every time the in-game asset the player earns is re-sold, they pocket the royalties of the secondary sale.


### What is NFT metadata?


Web3 gaming opens up a whole new world of opportunities for NFT use cases with in-game assets and the play-to-earn principle.


The composition of the NFT itself, however, remains the same as in other sectors and industries.


You might already know that what makes the NFT unique isnâ€™t so much the art you see in the front but the metadata that describes it in the back.


In short, NFT metadata is a string of text and numbers that contains essential information about the NFT, including its name, description, traits, attributes, link to the image, and other information.


Itâ€™s a crucial part of the NFTâ€Šâ€”â€Šwithout the NFT metadata, the NFT holds no real value.


Itâ€™s important to note that NFT metadata and content are usually stored separately from the NFT smart contract for both technical and financial reasons. And this is precisely where problems can arise with some options being safer than others.


### How can IPFS help make in-game NFTs moreÂ secure?


One of the reasons why some remain skeptical on the subject of Web3 gaming is safety and reliability. Unfortunately, hacking incidents and other malfunctions can shake the trust of the industry as a whole.


The fact is your NFT can disappear if its NFT metadata and content arenâ€™t stored properly.


Everybody remembers the collapse of the FTX, where countless NFTs went missing because the NFT metadata was stored on a centralized server.


The best way to store and share NFT metadata is through a distributed and reliable network that ensures copies of your files and content are safely stored in a decentralized and transparent way.


ðŸ”Ž This is where IPFS comes in. IPFS is a decentralized protocol that enables you to store and share data via a distributed peer-to-peer network. A decentralized network of nodes that are dispersed across the globe, IPFS is the most common and tried way to store NFT metadata. ðŸ‘‡

Web3 gaming holds great potential for returning the power into the hands of the players and providing a better, more immersive gaming experience, but if the playersâ€™ in-game assets arenâ€™t properly protected, the phrase true digital ownership wonâ€™t mean much.
