### Top 5 titans of NFT loyalty programs


#### The future of fandom? It’s here and it’s way better than autographed jerseys. Explore 5 creative programs that are redefining the NFT game!


NFTs have become a viable option for success in any domain with a fan base. The technology enables artists, musicians, sports players, and others to wrap their digital goods in code and put them up for sale.


That way, the process mimics the traditional art markets and other marketplaces in a fully digital and decentralized way.


With unique benefits for both fans and creators, NFTs offer a new way to connect. We’ve identified what we believe are the most original NFT loyalty programs across various industries, all leveraging Web3 to engage with their fans and users.


### 1. NBA Top Shot: Redefining sports collectibles


Imagine every game-winning shot you’ve ever screamed at the TV, all captured as NFT-based digital memorabilia. These trading cards are rare, unique, and 100% owned by the collector.


Imagine adding that kind of engagement for basketball lovers beyond couch potato game-watching. At home. By the TV. Like animals. Instead, one can own a piece of the action while still yelling at the referee from home.

NBA Top Shot has redefined sports collectibles by giving fans direct ownership of memorable plays, making the fan experience more personal and interactive. It's even better than being courtside—have you ever imagined saying that?

In 2021, Kings of Leon dropped their When You See Yourself album as an NFT—because why sell CDs when you can sell lifetime front-row seats and a personal driver in the form of bonus-packed NFTs?


Fans got more than just tunes; they unlocked everything from limited-edition vinyl to rockstar-level perks. Brilliant!
