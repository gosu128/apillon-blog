### What are Web3 games?


#### Player-oriented Web3 games have transformed the gaming experience using blockchain technology, NFTs, and other decentralized technologies.


The principles of Web3 are changing how we act and interact with data in the digital world in a wide range of sectors, from finance, art, supply chains, governance, and healthcare to gaming.


No matter the industry, Web3 shifts traditionally centralized systems towards more decentralized, user-centric, and open structures. No more centralized platforms and services that a few large corporations control.


In this article, we look at how Web3 influences the gaming industry and what exactly are Web3 games, often called blockchain games or decentralized games.


### Understanding Web3


Before looking at how Web3 games integrate the core Web3 principles, let’s refresh our memory.


What are some of the main Web3 principles?


Aiming to reduce centralization, Web3 is defined by distributing control and authority across a network of nodes or participants. This decentralization is often achieved through blockchain technology and peer-to-peer networks.


Users have greater ownership and control over their digital identities, data, and assets. They can decide how their information is shared and used, reducing the power of centralized entities.


Self-sovereign identity systems allow individuals to manage and share personal information without relying on centralized authorities. Users regain control over their digital identities.


Web3 puts a lot of importance on transparency in transactions, data handling, and governance. Blockchain’s public ledger ensures that anyone can verify transactions and actions on the network.


Community-driven governance models, where users and stakeholders have a say in decision-making, help promote fairness and inclusivity.


With a strong emphasis on security and privacy, Web3 often relies on cryptographic methods to protect user data and transactions.


### What are Web3 games?


Web3 games integrate the main principles of Web3 and blockchain technology to deliver a player-oriented, innovative, and decentralized gaming experience. What does this mean?


To provide players with more control over the game, Web3 games or blockchain games incorporate technologies such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), blockchain-based assets, decentralized ownership, and, often, cryptocurrency.


Blockchain games are defined by having game assets that are owned by players in custodial wallets by players in the form of NFTs.


Maybe the following examples can help paint a clearer picture.


Launched in 2017, the first example of a Web3 game was CryptoKitties, where players collected and bred unique virtual cats as NFTs. One of the most famous Web3 games is Axie Infinity, which is a play-to-earn game where players can collect and battle fantasy creatures called Axies.
