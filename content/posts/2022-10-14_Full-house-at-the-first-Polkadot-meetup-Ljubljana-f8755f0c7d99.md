### Full house at the first Polkadot meetup Ljubljana


#### Apillon organized the first Polkadot meetup in Ljubljana and brought together over 80 Web3 enthusiasts from Slovenia.


October is in full swing, and so was Apillon’s first event under the new brand. What was planned as a small gathering of local blockchain enthusiasts turned out to be a country-wide meetup of developers, IT students, and Web3 believers. Never in our wildest dreams did we imagine people queuing to enter the event hall nor participants hanging out at the venue late into the night, debating Polkadot. Even well after we ran out of beer and pizza.


### The topics discussed


The event began with opening remarks by Domen Uršič, CMO at Apillon, as he warmly welcomed a packed hall of Web3 enthusiasts. He presented a backstory of Apillon’s recent rebranding and the company’s future imprint on the Polkadot ecosystem.

Urban Osvald, Growth Manager at Web3 Foundation, presented the potential of Polkadot’s network as the future of Web3 building and explained how Polkadot addresses the current issues that hinder a wider adoption of blockchain technology.

Apillon’s CPO Nino Kutnjak enchanted the crowd with well-picked memes that hit the spot with aspiring blockchain developers and presented the nuts and bolts of the upcoming Apillon Web3 development platform. He invited all interested parties to the recently-opened Apillon discord channel to share their thoughts on the decentralized building.

The last one up, Damsky from KodaDot, discussed the hype around NFTs and their potential use cases. The core team behind KodaDot recently relocated to Bled, Slovenia, to establish a coworking space suitable for workations and team-building events. And of course, to provide their own team with a more stimulating environment to work on the NFT marketplace.
